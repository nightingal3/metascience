2012,Turing Machine-Inspired Computer Science Results.,"Abstract
This paper discusses how the Turing machine model directly inspired and guided developments in theoretical computer science. In particular, the Turing machine model was ideal for the creation of computational complexity theory, which has grown into an essential part of theoretical computer science and has found application in other disciplines. The machine operation count was used to define time-bounded computations and the tape squares used defined the tape or memory-bounded computations. The definition and exploration of the corresponding asymptotic complexity classes followed naturally."
2003,Separation of complexity classes.,"Computational complexity theory is the study of the quantitative laws that govern computing. A central topic in this study is the classification of computational problems by the amount of various computational resources required for their solution and, particularly, to find the limits of feasible computation. Computational complexity has discovered (or defined) a beautiful structure of natural, mathematically robust complexity classes that give an intuitively satisfying classification of the feasibly and near-feasibly computable problems. These complexity classes are defined by the bounds on computational resources or by the natural complete problems to which other problems in the class can be easily reduced. They can also be defined very naturally, in a noncomputational way, by the expressive power of various logical formalisms, emphasizing that they are natural, robust and important mathematical objects. Unfortunately, notwithstanding considerable effort over several decades, there are no proofs that all these classes are indeed different. We consider the resolution of the separation questions for these complexity classes as one of the most important set of open problems in theoretical computer science. The solution of the separation problems is essential for deeper understanding of the nature of computing, the limits of feasible computation and, indirectly, the limits of feasible (axiomatic) reasoning"

1995,On the Weight of Computations.,"One of the Grand Challenges to computer science is to understand what is and is not feasibly computable. Recursive function theory clarified what is and is not effectively computable and in the process extended our understanding of Goedel incompleteness results about the limits of the power of formal mathematical methods. Since computing is universal and encompasses the power of mathematics, the understanding of the limits of the feasibly computable could give a deeper understanding of the limits of rational intellectual processes and insights into the power and limits of scientific theories. The search for what is and is not feasibly computable has two distinct aspects. The first is to determine (estimate) how much and what kind of computing power will be available in the foreseeable future. The other problem is to determine what kind of problems can be solved with these available computing resources. The first problem is a technological assessment of the existing and potential computing technologies to estimate what kind and how much computing work our machines will be able to render. The other problem leads us to the central questions of complexity theory: what is the intrinsic complexity of important classes of problems we wish to solve. Clearly, the P=NP=PSPACE? problems are among the best known in this area. In all these considerations, the exponential function seems to give a crude upper limit for the feasibly computable. May it be time, memory or weight requirements, if they grow exponentially, then the computations are not feasible. We do not know what computations require exponential amounts of resources, nor do all instances of problems in exponential complexity classes require exponential resources. Even if the exact solutions require exponential resources, good approximations to the solution may not. But if indeed the problem requires exponential resources, then it is clearly not feasibly solvable already for moderate size instances of the problem"
1995,On the Computing Paradigm and Computational Complexity.,"Abstract
Computational complexity theory is the study of the quantitative laws that govern computing. Since the computing paradigm is universal and pervasive, the quantitative laws of computational complexity apply to all information processing from numerical computations and simulation to logical reasoning and formal theorem proving, as well as processes of rational reasoning.
In this view, the search for what is and is not feasibly computable takes on an even deeper significance than just a central problem in theoretical computer science. The search for the limits of what is feasibly computable is the search for the limits of scientific theories and, possibly, rational reasoning."

1994,The Random Oracle Hypothesis Is False.,"The Random Oracle Hypothesis, attributed to Bennett and Gill, essentially states that the relationships between complexity classes which hold for almost all relativized worlds must also hold in the unrelativized case. Although this paper is not the first to provide a counterexample to the Random Oracle Hypothesis, it does provide a most compelling counterexample by showing that for almost all oracles A, IPA ‚â† PSPACEA. If the Random Oracle Hypothesis were true, it would contradict Shamir's result that IP = PSPACE. In fact, it is shown that for almost all oracles A, co-NPA ‚´ã IPA. These results extend to the multiprover proof systems of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Killian, and Wigderson. In addition, this paper shows that the Random Oracle Hypothesis is sensitive to small changes in the definition. A class IPP, similar to IP, is defined. Surprisingly, the IPP = PSPACE result holds for all oracle worlds."

We also solve an open problem of Razborov using our exact bound on the topological dimension."

1993,Computing the Future: Whither Computer Science and Engineering?,"The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Research Council recently released a report entitled Computing the Future: A Broader Agenda for Computer Science and Engineering. The report is intended as a first step in developing a vision of computer science and engineering that will carry the discipline into the 21st Century. Acknowledging the fraying of the social compact that has supported scientific research since World War II, pressures on academic science, and major changes in the computer industry, the report puts forward a view that the intellectual boundaries of the CS&E discipline should expand. The discipline should continue to support what has been traditionally been considered ‚Äúcore‚Äù computer science and engineering, but it should also learn to embrace rather than eschew computing problems that arise in domains outside the traditional core. Such problem domains include other sciences and areas with commercial or economic, significance. This broader agenda will have many benefits for CS&E, including a rich set of intellectually challenging problems, greater social impact, and a wider variety of funding opportunities. Not surprisingly, this vision of the field in the 21st Century has generated considerable controversy and debate, as is appropriate for matters as important as these. A panel will briefly review the major judgments, priorities, and recommendations of the report, and differing perspectives on the report will be aired."
1993,Some Observations About the Nature of Computer Science.,"Abstract
This paper discusses the nature of computer science as a science by analyzing computer science and comparing or contrasting it with other sciences. In particular, we compare and contrast various aspects of computer science with physics, astronomy, and mathematics. Our analysis of computer science and comparison with other sciences is primarily in terms of:
(a)
the roles played by experiments and theory,
 (b)
how research paradigms and problem areas are determined and change,
 (c)
the relation and interaction of the science and engineering aspects,
 (d)
comparing historical developments.
 From this study and comparisons we conclude that computer science differs from the known sciences so deeply that it has to be viewed as a new species among the sciences. This view is justified by observing that theory and experiments in computer science play a different role and do not follow the classic pattern in physical sciences. The change of research paradigms in computer science is often technology driven and demos can play the role of experiments. Furthermore, the science and engineering aspects are deeply interwoven in computer science, where the distance from concepts to practical implementations is far shorter than in other disciplines."

Furthermore, for this computation model, we show that Savitch's theorem and the Immerman-Szelepcs√©nyi theorem do not hold in the range lg lg n to lg n. We also present other changes in the computation model which bring out and clarify the importance of space constructibility. We conclude by enumerating open problems which arise out of the discussion."

1989,The Boolean Hierarchy II: Applications.,"The Boolean Hierarchy I: Structural Properties [J. Cai et al., SIAM J. Comput ., 17 (1988), pp. 1232ñ252] explores the structure of the boolean hierarchy, the closure of NP with respect to boolean operations. This paper uses the boolean hierarchy as a tool with which to extend and explain three important results in structural complexity theory.
(1) Hartmanis, Immerman, and Sewelson [ Proc. 15th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computation, 1983, pp. 382ñ391] showed that ${\text{E}} = {\text{NE}}$ if and only if ${\text{NP}} - {\text{P}}$ contains no sparse sets. In this paper it is shown that this reflects a behavior of the boolean hierarchy. When ${\text{E}} = {\text{NE}}$, sparse sets fall from alternate levels of the boolean hierarchy (Fig. 2(a)). Furthermore, it is shown that capturable sets (i.e., subsets of sparse NP sets) are banished from the boolean hierarchy when ${\text{E}} = {\text{NE}}:{\text{E}} = {\text{NE}}$ implies that ${\text{BH}} - {\text{P}}$ has no capturable sets.
(2) Counting classes are natural candidates as complete languages for the levels of the boolean hierarchy. The authors show that in relativized worlds counting classes are not complete for the levels of the boolean hierarchy. Relatedly, the work of Blass and Gurevich [Inform, and Control, 55 (1982), pp. 80ñ88] is extended and it is concluded that counting classes are weak in some relativized worlds.
(3) Karp and Lipton [Proc. 12th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computation, 1980, pp. 302ñ309] showed that if NP has a sparse oracle (i.e., if there is a sparse set S so ${\text{NP}} \subseteq {\text{P}}^S $; equivalently, if NP has small circuits), then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to ${\text{NP}}^{{\text{NP}}} $. The authors demonstrate that this cannot be much improved. There is a relativized world in which NP has a sparse oracle, yet the boolean hierarchy is infinite. Thus no proof that relativizes can show: NP has .a sparse oracle implies that the polynomial hierarchy equals the boolean hierarchy.
The results of this paper present new ideas and techniques, and put previous results about NP and ${\text{D}}^{\text{P}} $ in a richer perspective. Throughout, the emphasis is on the structure of the boolean hierarchy and its relations with more common classes.

1988,On Sparse Oracles Separating Feasible Complexity Classes.,"Abstract
This article clarifies which oracles separate NP from P and which do not. In essence, we are changing our research paradigm from the study of which problems can be relativized in two conflicting ways to the study and characterization of the class of oracles achieving a specified relativation. Results of this type have the potential to yield deeper insights into the nature of relativation problems and focus our attention on new and interesting classes of languages.
A complete and transparent characterization of oracles that separate NP from P would resolve the long-standing P = ?NP question. Here we settle a central case. We fully characterize the sparse oracles separating NP from P in worlds where P = NP. These separating oracles are exactly the non-self-printable sets. Equivalently, they are the sets of high self-referential Kolmogorov complexity. We prove related results about co-NP and PSPACE."
1988,The Boolean Hierarchy I: Structural Properties.,"In this paper, we study the complexity of sets formed by boolean operations (union, intersection, and complement) on NP sets. These are the sets accepted by trees of hardware with NP predicates as leaves, and together these form the boolean hierarchy.
We present many results about the structure of the boolean hierarchy: separation and immunity results, natural complete languages, and structural asymmetries between complementary classes.
We show that in some relativized worlds the boolean hierarchy is infinite, and that for every k there is a relativized world in which the boolean hierarchy extends exactly k levels. We prove natural languages, variations of VERTEX COVER, complete for the various levels of the boolean hierarchy. We show the following structural asymmetry: though no set in the boolean hierarchy is ${\text{D}}^{\text{P}} $-immune, there is a relativized world in which the boolean hierarchy contains ${\text{coD}}^{\text{P}} $-immune sets.Thus, this paper explores the structural properties of the boolean hierarchy. A companion paper [J. Cai et al., SIAM J. Comput. 18 (1989), to appear] uses the boolean hierarchy to extend known results on small circuits [R. Karp and R. Lipton, Proc. 12th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computation, 1980, pp. 302ñ309], sparse sets in NP-P [J. Hartmanis, N. Immerman, and V. Sewelson, Proc.15th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computation, 1983, pp. 382ñ391], and counting classes [A. Blass and Y. Gurevich, Inform. and Control, 55 (1982), pp. 80ñ88].

1988,Complexity Classes without Machines: On Complete Languages for UP.,"Abstract
This paper develops techniques for studying complexity classes that are not covered by known recursive enumerations of their machines. Counting classes, probabilistic classes, and intersection classes often lack such enumerations. Concentrating on the counting class UP, we show that there are relativizations for which UPA has no complete languages and other relativizations for which PB‚â†UPB‚â†NPB and UPB has complete languages. Among other results we show that
1.
(1) UP has complete languages if and only if there exists a set R in P of Boolean formulas, each having at most one satisfying assignment so that SAT‚à©R is complete for UP.
2.
(2) P ‚â† UP if and only if there exists a set S in P of Boolean formulas, each having at most one satisfying assignment, such that S ‚à© SAT is not in P.
3.
(3) P ‚â† UP ‚à© coUP if and only if there exists a set S in P of uniquely satisfiable Boolean formulas such that no polynomial-time machine can compute the solutions for the formulas in S.
We suggest the wide applicability of our techniques to counting and probabilistic classes by using them to examine the probabilistic class BPP. There is a relativized word where BPPA has no complete languages. If BPP has complete languages, then it has a complete language of the form B ‚à© Majority, where

In addition, the paper uses relativization techniques to determine logical possibilities, limitations of these proof techniques, and exhibits one of the first natural structural differences between relativized NP and CoNP."
1985,Independence Results About Context-Free Languages and Lower Bounds.,"Abstract
We show that for any axiomatizable, sound formal system F there exist instances of natural problems about context-free languages, lower bounds of computations and P versus NP that are not provable in F for any recursive representation of these problems. Most previous independence results in computer science have been proven for specific representations of the problems, by exploiting the ‚Äòopaqueness‚Äô of Turing machine names. Our results rely on the complexity of the logical structure of the problem and yield independence results which do not depend on the representations of problems. We show, for example, that there exists a nonregular context-free language L0 such that for no cf-grammar G, L(G) = L0, it is provable in F that ‚ÄúL(G) is not regular‚Äù. We also show, among other results about P and NP, that there exists a recursive oracle A such that NPA ‚â† PA, and that this fact is not provable in F for any recursive representation of A.
The difference of what is and is not provable in F is well illustrated by questions about polynomial time isomorphisms (p-isomorphisms) of NP-complete sets. We show that for every NP-complete set, L, there is a representation of L by a nondeterministic polynomial time machine for which we can prove that L is NP-complete. Furthermore, if L is p-isomorphic to SAT, then this is also provable in F for some representation of L. On the other hand, if there exist NP-complete sets not p-isomorphic to SAT, then there exists an NP-complete set L for which, independent of its representation, there is no proof in F that L is or is not p-isomorphic to SAT."

Furthermore, we show that if a complete language L0 exists for NP‚à©CoNP and NP‚à©CoNP‚â†NP then the reduction of L(Nt) Œµ NP‚à©CoNP cannot be effectively computed from Nt.

In this paper we study the computational complexity of sets of different densities in NP. We show that the deterministic computation time for sets in NP can depend on their density if and only if there is a collapse or partial collapse of the corresponding higher nondeterministic and deterministic time bounded complexity classes. We show also that for NP sets of different densities there exist complete sets of the corresponding density under polynomial time Turing reductions. Finally, we show that these results can be interpreted as results about the complexity of theorem proving and proof presentation in axiomatized mathematical systems. This interpretation relates fundamental questions about the complexity of our intellectual tools to basic structural problems about P, NP, CoNP and Pspace, discussed in this paper."

1983,Generalized Kolmogorov Complexity and the Structure of Feasible Computations (Preliminary Report).,"Abstract:
In this paper we define a generalized, two-parameter, Kolmogorov complexity of finite strings which measures how much and how fast a string can be compressed and we show that this string complexity measure is an efficient tool for the study of computational complexity. The advantage of this approach is that it not only classifies strings as random or not random, but measures the amount of randomness detectable in a given time. This permits the study how computations change the amount of randomness of finite strings and thus establish a direct link between computational complexity and generalized Kolmogorov complexity of strings. This approach gives a new viewpoint for computational complexity theory, yields natural formulations of new problems and yields new results about the structure of feasible computations."

Finally, we show that these results can be interpreted as results about the complexity of theorem proving and proof presentation in axiomatized mathematical systems.

In addition, the paper uses relativization techniques to determine logical possibilities, limitations of these proof techniques, and, for the first time, to exhibit structural differences between relativized NP and CoNP."
1982,A Note on Natural Complete Sets and G√∂del Numberings.,"Abstract
Creative sets or the complete recursively enumerable sets play an important role in logic and mathematics and they are known to be recursively isomorphic. Therefore, on the one hand, all the complete sets can be viewed as equivalent, on the other hand, we intuitively perceive some complete sets as more ‚Äònatural and simpler‚Äô than others. In this note we try to capture this intuitive concept precisely by defining a complete set to be natural if all other recursively enumerable sets can be reduced to it by computationally simple reductions and show that these natural complete sets are all isomorphic under the same type of computationally simple mappings. The same ideas are applied to define natural G√∂del numberings and, using natural G√∂del numberings, to show that natural creative sets coincide with the natural complete sets."

An attempt is also made to draw some general conclusions about computer science research and to discuss the nature of theoretical computer science."
1981,Languages Simultaneously Complete for One-Way and Two-Way Log-Tape Automata.,"In this paper we study languages accepted by nondeterministic $\log n$-tape automata that scan their input only once and relate their computational power to two-way $\log n$-tape automata. We show that for the one-way $\log n$-tape automata the nondeterministic model (1-NL) is computationally much more powerful than the deterministic model (1-L), that under one-way $\log n$-tape reductions there exist natural complete languages for these automata and that the complete languages cannot be sparse. Furthermore, we show that any language complete for nondeterministic one-way $\log n$-tape automata (under 1-L reductions) is also complete for the computationally more powerful nondeterministic two-way $\log n$-tape automata (NL) under two-way $\log n$-tape reductions. Therefore, for all bounds $T(n)$, $T(n) \geqq \log n$, the deterministic and nondeterministic $T(n)$-tape bounded computations collapse iff the nondeterministic one-way $\log n$-tape computations can be carried out by two-way deterministic log n-tape automata.

1980,On the Succinctness of Different Representations of Languages.,"The purposes of this paper is to give simple new proofs of some interesting recent results about the relative succinctness of different representations of regular, deterministic and unambiguous context-free languages and to derive some new results about how the relative succinctness of representations change when the representations contain a formal proof that the languages generated are in the desired subclass of languages."
1980,An Eassay about Research on Sparse NP Complete Sets.,"Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to review the origins and motivation for the conjecture that sparse NP complete sets do not exist (unless P = NP) and to describe the development of the ideas and techniques which led to the recent solution of this conjecture."
1979,"Relations Between Diagonalization, Proof Systems, and Complexity Gaps.","Abstract
In this paper we study diagonal processes over time bounded computations of one-tape Turing machines by diagonalizing only over those machines for which there exist formal proofs that they operate in the given time bound. This replaces the traditional ‚Äúclock‚Äù in resource bounded diagonalization by formal proofs about running times and establishes close relations between properties of proof systems and existence of sharp time bounds for one-tape Turing machine complexity classes. These diagonalization methods also show that the Gap Theorem for resource bounded computations can hold only for those complexity classes which differ from the corresponding provable complexity classes. Furthermore, we show that there exist recursive time bounds T(n) such that the class of languages for which we can formally prove the existence of Turing machines which accept them in time T(n) differs from the class of languages accepted by Turing machines for which we can prove formally that they run in time T(n). We also investigate the corresponding problems for tape bound computations and discuss the difference time and tapebounded computations."
1979,Observations about the Development of Theoretical Computer Science.,"Abstract:
This paper gives a personal account of some developments in automata theory and computational complexity theory. Though the account is subjective and deals primarily with the research areas of direct interest to the author, it discusses the underlying beliefs and philosophy which guided this research as well as the intellectual environment and the ideas and contacts which influenced it. An attempt is also made to draw some general conclusions about computer science research and to discuss the nature of theoretical computer science."
1979,"Succinctness, Verifiability and Determinism in Representations of Polynomial-Time Languages.","Abstract:
Several representations of P, the class of deterministic polynomial time acceptable languages, are compared with respect to succinctness. It is shown that requirements such as polynomial running time, verifiability of running time, and verifiability of accepting a set in P can be causes for differences in succinctness that are not recursively bounded. Relating succinctness to nondeterminism, it is shown that P ‚â† NP if and only if the relative succinctness of representing languages in P by deterministic and nondeterministic clocked polynomial time machines is not recursively bounded. questions are posed, concerning the implications of P = NP, with respect to translatability and succinctness between other pairs of deterministic and nondeterministic representations for P."
1979,On the Succintness of Different Representations of Languages.,"Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to give simple new proofs of some interesting recent results about the relative succinctness of different representations of regular, deterministic and unambiguous context-free languages and to derive some new results about how the relative succinctness of representations change when the representations contain a formal proof that the languages generated are in the desired subclass of languages."
1979,Relative Succinctness of Representations of Languages and Separation of Complexity Classes.,"Abstract
In this paper we study the relative succinctness of different representations of deterministic polynomial time languages and investigate what can and cannot be formally verified about these representations. We also show that the relative succinctness of different representations of languages is directly related to the separation of the corresponding complexity classes; for example, PTIME ‚â† NPTIME if and only if the relative succinctness of representing languages in PTIME by deterministic and nondeterministic clocked polynomial time machines is not recursively bounded, which happens if and only if the relative succinctness of these representations is not linearly bounded.
Furthermore, we discuss the problem of approximating the recognition of complete languages in NPTIME by deterministic polynomial time machines which accept finite initial segments of these languages. We conclude by discussing the relative succinctness of optimal and near-optimal programs and the nature of the families of minimal machines for different representations."
1978,On Polynomial Time Isomorphisms of Some New Complete Sets.,"Abstract
In this note we show that the recently discovered NP complete sets arising in number theory, the PTAPE complete sets arising in game theory, and EXTAPE complete sets arising from algebraic word problems are polynomial time isomorphic to the previously known complete sets in the corresponding classes."
1978,On Log-Tape Isomorphisms of Complete Sets.,"Abstract
In this paper we study log n-tape computable reductions between sets and investigate conditions under which log n-tape reductions between sets can be extended to log n-tape computable isomorphisms of these sets. As an application of these results we obtain easy to check necessary and sufficient conditions that sets complete under log n-tape reductions in NL, CSL, P, NP, PTAPE, etc. are log n-tape isomorphic to the previously known complete sets in the respective classes. As a matter of fact, all the ‚Äúknown‚Äù complete sets for NL, CSL, P, NP, PTAPE, etc. are now easily seen to be, respectively, log n-tape isomorphic. These results strengthen and extend substantially the previously known results about polynomial time computable reductions and isomorphisms of NP and PTAPE complete sets. Furthermore, we show that any set complete in CSL, PTAPE, etc. must be dense and therefore, for example, cannot be over a single letter alphabet."
1978,One-Way Log-Tape Reductions.,"Abstract:
One-way log-tape (1-L) reductions are mappings defined by log-tape Turing machines whose read head on the input can only move to the right. The 1-L reductions provide a more refined tool for studying the feasible complexity classes than the P-time [2,7] or log-tape [4] reductions. Although the 1-L computations are provably weaker than the feasible classes L, NL, P and NP, the known complete sets for those classes are complete under 1-L reductions. However, using known techniques of counting arguments and recursion theory we show that certain log-tape reductions cannot be 1-L and we construct sets that are complete under log-tape reductions but not under 1-L reductions."
1977,On Isomorphisms and Density of NP and Other Complete Sets.,"If all $NP$ complete sets are isomorphic under deterministic polynomial time mappings (p-isomorphic) then $P \ne NP$ and if all PTAPE complete sets are P-isomorphic then $P \ne {\text{PTAPE}}$. We show that all $NP$ complete sets known (in the literature) are indeed p-isomorphic and so are the known PTAPE complete sets. This shows that, in spite of the radically different origins and attempted simplification of these sets, all the known $NP$ complete sets are identical but for simple isomorphic codings computable in deterministic polynomial time.
Furthermore, if all $NP$ complete sets are p-isomorphic then they all must have similar densities and, for example, no language over a single letter alphabet can be $NP$ complete, nor can any sparse language over an arbitrary alphabet be $NP$ complete. We show that complete sets in EXPTIME and EXPTAPE cannot be sparse and therefore they cannot be over a single letter alphabet. Similarly, we show that the hardest context-sensitive languages cannot be sparse. We also relate the existence of sparse complete sets to the existence of simple combinatorial circuits for the corresponding truncated recognition problem of these languages.

1977,"Relations Between Diagonalization, Proof Systems, and Complexity Gaps (Preliminary Version).","In this paper we study diagonal processes over time-bounded computations of one-tape Turing machines by diagonalizing only over those machines for which there exist formal proofs that they operate in the given time bound. This replaces the traditional ‚Äúclock‚Äù in resource bounded diagonalization by formal proofs about running times and establishes close relations between properties of proof systems and existence of sharp time bounds for one-tape Turing machine complexity classes. Furthermore, these diagonalization methods show that the Gap Theorem for resource bounded computations does not hold for complexity classes consisting only of languages accepted by Turing machines for which it can be formally proven that they run in the required time bound."
1977,On polynomial time isomorphisms of complete sets.,"In this note we show that the recently discovered NP complete sets arising in number theory, the PTAPE complete sets arising in game theory and EXPTAPE complete sets arising from algebraic word problems are polynomial time isomorphic to the previously known complete sets in the corresponding categories."
1976,On the Structure of Feasible Computations.,"
The theory of computational complexity is the study of the quantitative aspects of computing, and it has been an active area of computer science research for some years. During this time, the computational complexity theory developed so rapidly that by now it has become a principal part of theoretical computer science and one of the most active research areas in all of computer science. The development of computational complexity theory can be divided roughly into two parts. The first phase of this development established the general properties of specific computational measures, such as computation time and memory used, and provided an elegant axiomatic approach for the systematic investigation of properties common to all computational complexity measures. The purpose of this chapter is to give an overview of this development in the study of feasible computations and to give an insight into some of the recent results, as well as an appreciation of the unity and structure that have emerged in this area of research. To achieve these goals, this chapter treats only a selected set of topics that illustrate the major ideas and show the unity of the emerging understanding and emphasize the essential open problems."
1976,On Effective Speed-Up and Long Proofs of Trivial Theorems in Formal Theories.,"In this note we give a very simple proof which shows that in many interesting formal mathematical theories, axiomatizable as well as decidable ones, for every given formalization we can effectively find infinite subsets of trivially true theorems which require as long proofs in the given formalism as the hardest theorems of the theory. Thus showing that for these theories every formalism is doomed to be blind to the triviality of infinite sets of theorems, which can be found effectively. Furthermore, it follows that for all (sufficiently large) constructable tape and time bounds there exist sets whose recognition can be effectively speeded up on infinite subsets and that such sets appear naturally. Thus showing that for many concrete problems every algorithm can be effectively sped-up on infinite subsets."
1976,On Tape Bounds for Single Letter Alphabet Language Processing.,"Abstract
In this paper we show that the tape bounded complexity classes of languages over single letter alphabets (sla) are closed under complementation. We then use this results to show by means of diagonalization that there exists an infinite hierarchy of tape bounded complexity classes of sla languages between log log n and log n tape bounds. On the other hand, we show that the power of diagonalization over sla inputs with less than log n tape is very limited by proving that every infinite sla language accepted using less than log n tape contains infinite regular subsets. From this result it immediately follows that the set of primes in unary notation, P, requires exactly log n tape for its recognition and every infinite subset of P requires at least log n tape."
1976,On Isomorphisms and Density of NP and Other Complete Sets.,"If all NP complete sets are isomorphic under deterministic polynomial time mappings (p-isomorphic) then P @@@@ NP and if all PTAPE complete sets are p-isomorphic then P @@@@ PTAPE. We show that all NP complete sets known (in the literature) are indeed p-isomorphic and so are the known PTAPE complete sets. Thus showing that, inspite of the radically different origins and attempted simplification of these sets, all the known NP complete sets are identical but for polynomially time bounded permutations. Furthermore, if all NP complete sets are p-isomorphic then they all must have similar densities and, for example, no language over a single letter alphabet can be NP complete, nor can any sparse language over an arbitrary alphabet be NP complete. We show that complete sets in EXPTIME and EXPTAPE cannot be sparse and therefore they cannot be over a single letter alphabet. Similarly, we show that the hardest context-sensitive languages cannot be sparse. We also relate the existence of sparse complete sets to the existence of simple combinatorial circuits for the corresponding truncated recognition problem of these languages."
1975,Computational Complexity of Formal Translations.,"Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to define a mathematical model for the study of quantitative problems about translations between universal languages and to investigate such problems. The results derived in this paper deal with the efficiency of the translated algorithms, the optimality of translations and the complexity of the translation process between different languages."
1975,On Simple Godel Numberings and Translations.,"In this paper we consider classes of Goedel numberings, viewed as simple models for programming languages, into which all other Goedel numberings can be translated by computationally simple mappings. Several such classes of Goedel numberings are defined and their properties are investigated. For example, one such class studied is the class of Goedel numberings into which all other Goedel numberings can be translated by finite automata mappings. We also compare these classes of Goedel numberings to the class of optimal Goedel numberings and show that translation into optimal Goedel numberings can be computationally arbitrarily complex, thus indicating that from a computer science point of view, optimal Goedel numberings have undesirable properties."
1975,A Note on Tape Bounds for SLA Language Processing.,"Abstract:
In this note we show that the tape bounded complexity classes of languages over single letter alphabets are closed under complementation. We then use this result to show that there exists an infinite hierarchy of tape bounded complexity classes of sla languages between log n and log log n tape bounds. We also show that every infinite sla language recognizable on less than log n tape has infinitely many different regular subsets, and, therefore, the set of primes in unary notation, P, requires exactly log n tape for its recognition and every infinite subset of P requires at least log n tape."
1974,On the Power of Multiplication in Random Access Machines.,"Abstract:
We consider random access machines with a multiplication operation, having the added capability of computing logical operations on register are considered both as an integer and as a vector of bits and both arithmetic and boolean operations may be used on the same register. We prove that, counting one operation as a unit of time and considering the machines as acceptors, deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial time acceptable languages are the same, and are exactly the languages recognizable in polynomial tape by Turing machines. We observe that the same measure on machines without multiplication is polynomially related to Turing machine time-thus the added computational power due to multiplication in random access machines is equivalent to the computational power which polynomially tape-bounded Turing machine computations have over polynomially time-bounded computations. Therefore, in this formulation, it is not harder to multiply than to add if and only if PTAPE = PTIME for Turing machines. We also discuss other instruction sets for random access machines and their computational power."
1974,On the Structure of Feasible Computation.,"Abstract
During the last four years research on lower level computational complexity has yielded a rich set of interesting results which have revealed deep and unexpected connections between various problems and thus brought new unity to this area of computer science. This work has also yielded new techniques and insights which are likely to have further applications, and it has identified some very central problems in the quantitative theory of computing. The purpose of this paper is to give the reader an overview of these developments, an insight into some of these results and applications, as well as an appreciation of the unity and structure which has emerged in this area of research."
1974,On Simple Goedel Numberings and Translations.,"Abstract

Several such classes of Goedel numberings are defined and their properties are investigated. For example, one such class studied is the class of Goedel numberings into which all other Goedel numberings can be translated by finite automatic mappings. We also compare these classes of Goedel numberings to the class of optimal Goedel numberings and show that translation into optimal Goedel numberings can be computationally arbitrarily complex. Thus indicating that from a computer science point of view optimal Goedel numberings have undesirable properties."
1973,Group Theoretic Characterization of Linear Permutation Automata.,"In this paper we characterize all permutation automata which can be linearly realized over the field GF(p) in terms of the group generated by the automaton. From this group theoretic characterization of linear permutation automata we derive, among other results, a complete characterization of all homomorphisms of a linear automaton which yield linearly realizable image automata as well as several results about the structure of linear automata."
1973,On the Problem of Finding Natural Computational Complexity Measures.,"To develop an abstract theory which deals with the quantitative aspects of computing we need a deeper understanding of how to define ``natural'''' computational complexity measures axiomatically. To this end, this paper summarizess the principal properties which hold for some natural complexity measures but not for all measures and which have been proposed as desirable properties of natural measuress. The paper discusses the nature of these properties, studies their interrelations and their possible values towards defining natural computational complexity measures. A number off open problems are discussed and directions for further research are suggested."
1972,On Non-Determinancy in Simple Computing Devices.,"Summary
This paper studies one-tape Turing machines with k read-only heads which are restricted to the original input. The main result shows that if any set accepted by such a 3-head non-deterministic Turing machine can be accepted by a deterministic Turing machine with more read-only heads, then the deterministic and non-deterministic context-sensitive languages are identical. Several related results are derived and some tantalizing open problems are discussed."
1971,An Overview of the Theory of Computational Complexity.,"The purpose of this paper is to outline the theory of computational complexity which has emerged as a comprehensive theory during the last decade. This theory is concerned with the quantitative aspects of computations and its central theme is the measuring of the difficulty of computing functions. This paper concentrates on the study of computational complexity measures defined for all computable functions and makes no attempt to survey the whole field exhaustively nor to present the material in historical order. Rather it presents the basic concepts, results, and techniques of computational complexity from a new point of view from which the ideas are more easily understood and fit together as a coherent whole."
1971,The use of Lists in the Study of Undecidable Problems in Automata Theory.,"Many of the problems in automata theory are unsolvable and can be classified intodegrees of unsolvability by their relative difficulty. In this note, natural reference sets are presented which belong to the complete degrees at each level of the arithmetic hierarchy. Also, some questions regarding lists of recursively enumerable sets are considered. These results resolve some apparent peculiarities and provide simple methods of determining the degrees of unsolvability for several well-known problems and permit easy construction of natural problems with high degrees of unsolvability."
1971,Computational Complexity of Random Access Stored Program Machines.,"In this paper we explore the computational complexity measure defined by running times of programs on random access stored program machines, RASP's. The purpose of this work is to study more realistic complexity measures and to provide a setting and some techniques to explore different computer organizations. The more interesting results of this paper are obtained by an argument about the size of the computed functions. For example, we show (without using diagonalization) that there exist arbitrarily complex functions with optimal RASP programs whose running time cannot be improved by any multiplicative constant. We show, furthermore, that these optimal programs cannot be fixed procedures and determine the difference in computation speed between fixed procedures and self-modifying programs. The same technique is used to compare computation speed of machines with and without built-in multiplication. We conclude the paper with a look at machines with associative memory and distributed logic machines."
1971,Complexity of Formal Translations and Speed-Up Results.,"The purpose of this paper is to give a model for the study of quantitative problems about formal translations from one programming language into another, as well as derive some initial results about the speed of programs produced by translations. The paper also contains a new speed-up result which shows that in any computational complexity measure there exist functions which have arbitrarily large speed-ups but that the size of the speed-up programs must grow non-computably fast."
1970,What makes Some Language Theory Problems Undecidable.,"In the theory of automata and formal languages, the undecidability of various properties has been studied for specific classes of languages. Here we abstract the essence of various proofs of undecidability and find wide classes of properties and general conditions on families of languages such that these proofs of undecidability hold. The paper also illustrates the manner in which the degree of undecidability of a property changes as we consider more and more complicated families of languages."
1970,A Note on One-Way and Two-Way Automata.,The purpose of this note is to show that there exist non-regular languages whose memory requirements for recognition by one-way and two-way automata differ by a double exponential and that this difference cannot be exceeded.
1970,R70-1 A Note on Computing Time for the Recognition of Context- Free Languages by a Single-Tape Turing Machine.,"Although considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the more ""algebraic"" properties of context-free languages, the quantitative aspects of the recognition and parsing of context- free languages are still far from well understood. It was shown by Kasami and Younger that for every context-free language there exists a multitape Turing machine which recognizes this language and uses no more than n 3 operations to process input words of length n. For one-tape Turing machines Hartmanis showed, using the Younger algorithm, that every context-free language can be recognized in n 5 operations. This result has now been improved in the paper under review. It is shown, by a careful implementation of the ToriiñKasamiñOzaki algorithm on a one-tape Turing machine, that every context-free language can be recognized in n 4 operations. Again, just like for the n 3 operation multitape result, it is not known how good this time bound is. On the other hand, the authors have been able to show in this paper that for linear context-free languages n 2 is the least-upper time bound for their recognition on one-tape Turing machines. This is done by showing that every linear language is n2-recognizable, and by recalling that there are linear languages whose recognition requires n2 operations on a one-tape machine."
1969,Automata-based computational complexity.,"Automata theory is the study of abstract computing devices, their organization, and their structure and computational power. Thus, automata theory is necessarily linked to other parts of mathematics which are concerned with ìconstructability,î but it goes further into the study of constructability by investigating a variety of abstract computing devices which perform these constructions, relating these devices to the algorithms they execute, and characterizing the simplicity of their operation.
An important goal of automata theory is to understand the computational processes in relation to various classes of problems. The theory must go beyond the notion of computability and include some measure of the difficulty of the computation and how the difficulty is related to the organization of the machine that performs the computation.
Two natural measures of the computational difficulty are the computation time and the amount of memory required to perform the computation on a given computing device. Both of these measures yield a rich computational complexity structure for the computable functions and a variety of results have been established about these complexity classes, their ordering, and their dependence on the organization of the computing device. Interesting applications of the memory-limited computations have been achieved in the study of context-free and context-sensitive languages, where several infinite hierarchies of complexity classes of these languages have been obtained.
"
1969,On the Complexity of Undecidable Problems in Automata Theory.,"Some general results about hierarchies of undecidable problems in automata theory are given, and studies are described which show how properties of sets accepted by automata (i.e. languages) change from decidable to undecidable problems as the computational power of the automata is increased. This work also yields unified techniques which characterize for different languages large classes of undecidable problems.
"
1969,Two Memory Bounds for the Recognition of Primes by Automata.,"This paper establishes two bounds for the rate of growth of memory in automata which recognize the set of primes.
"
1968,Computational Complexity of One-Tape Turing Machine Computations.,"The quantitative aspects of one-tape Turing machine computations are considered. It is shown, for instance, that there exists a sharp time bound which must be reached for the recognition of nonregular sets of sequences. It is shown that the computation time can be used to characterize the complexity of recursive sets of sequences, and several results are obtained about this classification. These results are then applied to the recognition speed of context-free languages and it is shown, among other things, that it is recursively undecidable how much time is required to recognize a nonregular context-free language on a one-tape Turing machine. Several unsolved problems are discussed."
1968,On the Recognition of Primes by Automata.,"A study of the problem of recognizing the set of primes by automata is presented. A simple algebraic condition is derived which shows that neither the set of primes nor any infinite subset of the set of primes can be accepted by a pushdown or finite automaton.

In view of this result an interesting open problem is to determine the ìweakestî automaton which can accept the set of primes. It is shown that the linearly bounded automaton can accept the set of primes, and it is conjectured that no automaton whose memory grows less rapidly can recognize the set of primes. One of the results shows that if this conjecture is true, it cannot be proved by the use of arguments about the distribution of primes, as described by the Prime Number Theorem. Some relations are established between two classical conjectures in number theory and the minimal rate of memory growth of automata which can recognize the set of primes."
1968,Tape-Reversal Bounded Turing Machine Computations.,"This paper studies the classification of recursive sets by the number of tape reversals required for their recognition on a two-tape Turing machine with a one-way input tape.
This measure yields a rich hierarchy of tape-reversal limited complexity classes and their properties and ordering are investigated. The most striking difference between this and the previously studied complexity measures lies in the fact that the ìspeed-upî theorem does not hold for slowly growing tape-reversal complexity classes. These differences are discussed, and several relations between the different complexity measures and languages are established.
"
1968,Structure of Undecidable Problems in Automata Theory.,The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the structure of undecidable problems in automata theory by investigating the degree of unsolvability of these problems. This is achieved by using Turing machines with oracles to define when one undecidable problem can be reduced to another and to establish an infinite hierarchy of (equivalent) undecidable problems. This hierarchy is then used to classify well-known undecidable problems about various families of automata and formal languages and to study the relations between these problems. This approach reveals a well defined structuring of the undecidable problems and permits a more systematic study of these problems and their relation to various families of automata.
1968,Tape Reversal Complexity Hierarchies.,"This paper studies the classification of recursive sets by the number of tape reversals required for their recognition on a two-tape Turing machine with a one-way input tape.
This measure yields a rich hierarchy of tape-reversal limited complexity classes and their properties and ordering are investigated. The most striking difference between this and the previously studied complexity measures lies in the fact that the ìspeed-upî theorem does not hold for slowly growing tape-reversal complexity classes. These differences are discussed, and several relations between the different complexity measures and languages are established.

1966,Minimal Feedback Realizations of Sequential Machines.,"Abstract:
In this note we define the amount of feedback in a realization of a sequential machine M, give a simple algorithm to compute the minimal amount of feedback which has to be present in any realization of M, and give a canonical realization of M which uses the minimal amount of feedback."
1965,Two Tests for the Linearity of Sequential Machines.,"Abstract:
This paper describes two tests for the existence of a linear state assignment for binary input sequential machines. The first test is based on ``transfer sequences'' which map one stationary state of a machine onto another stationary state. It is shown that from a minimal transfer sequence of a machine one can read off directly a linear assignment of this machine if one exists. The second test uses ``ignorance'' computations by means of partitions and previously developed results about sequential machine structure."
1965,Hierarchies of memory limited computations.,"Abstract:
This paper investigates the computational complexity of binary sequences as measured by the rapidity of their generation by multitape Turing machines. A ""translational"" method which escapes some of the limitations of earlier approaches leads to a refinement of the established hierarchy. The previous complexity classes are shown to possess certain translational properties. An related hierarchy of complexity classes of monotonic functions is examined"

1964,Computational complexity of recursive sequences.,"Abstract:
In this paper we investigate how numbers, functions, and sequences can be classified according to their computational complexity. The computational complexity is measured by how fast the number or function can be computed by a multitape computer (Turing machine). It is shown that by means of this measure the computational complexity of numbers and functions can be submitted to rigorous mathematical study and a number of results are obtained."
1964,On the application of pair algebra to automata theory.,"Abstract:
In this paper, we define and discuss generalizations of partition pairs on sequential machines. The object of these generalizations is to suggest a unified approach to problems of information flow and machine structure."
1963,Regularity Preserving Modifications of Regular Expressions.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of determining whether a set of sequences R\t', obtained by some given rule from a regular set of sequences R, is again a regular set. A number of such problems are solved in this paper and a basic technique is used which is easy to apply to problems of this type. This technique yields an explicit construction of the sequential machine which recognizes the sequences in R\t', if R\t' is a regular set.
Among other things it is shown that: (i) the derivative of a regular set R with respect to any set of sequences W is a regular set, although a regular expression designating this set cannot in general be computed; (ii) the set of sequences obtained from a regular set R by removing ‚Äúarbitrary halves‚Äù of the sequences in R and the set of these removed ‚Äúhalves‚Äù are both regular sets; (iii) the set of sequences, obtained from a regular set R by making no more than k changes in any m consecutive digits in sequences from R, is regular; (iv) the set of sequences which can be concatenated in one and only one way from sequences in R is regular."
1963,Further Results on the Structure of Sequential Machines.,n/a
1963,A Study of Feedback and Errors in Sequential Machines.,"Abstract:
The object of this paper is to study feedback in sequential machines, to classify (according to their seriousness) and analyze errors which arise in the state transitions of machines, and to establish some relations between feedback and errors. It is shown that the previously developed algebraic methods1,2 supply the necessary tools and a rigorous basis for this theory, and relate these new results to previously obtained results about the structure of sequential machines. For example, this work yields the necessary methods to detect the existence of a decomposition of machines into component machines so that the most ``serious'' errors of the computation can occur only in an isolated component machine. This leads to the possibility of imposing selectively different reliability conditions on the component machines to achieve high over-all reliability of the realizations."
1962,Loop-Free Structure of Sequential Machines.,"The object of this paper is to study the realization of a sequential machine from several smaller machines. The basic tools in this investigation are the partitions with the substitution property and the partition pairs. It is shown that to every (loop-free) realization of a sequential machine from n smaller machines corresponds a set of n partitions with the substitution property whose product is the zero partition. Conversely, it is shown that to every such set of n partitions corresponds a realization of the given sequential machine from n smaller machines. The natural ordering of these partitions is reflected in the information flow between the corresponding component machines and the algebraic operations defined between these partitions corresponding to the realization, govern the modifications of this realization. Finally, it is shown how the amount of information flowing between the component machines in a realization can be studied by means of partition pairs."
1962,Some Dangers in State Reduction of Sequential Machines.,"In this paper we investigate the negative effects of state reduction on the realization of a sequential machine. It is shown that state reduction can destroy realizations of a given sequential machine from sets of smaller machines and thus lead to a sequential machine that is harder to realize.
To understand some of the reasons why and when state reduction should be carried out, several results are obtained which describe the changes of the structure of a sequential machine under state reduction. It is seen that the undesirable effects of state reduction are closely associated with the failure of certain distributive laws to hold between the partitions used for state reduction and the partitions used in the realization of the unreduced machine."
1962,Maximal Autonomous Clocks of Sequential Machines.,"Abstract:
Some sequential machinies contain input-independent parts and can therefore be input-inependent machine (an autonomous clock) and an input-dependent machine. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the flow table are obtained for the existence of autonomous clocks in sequential machines, and the properties of these machines and their clocks are studied."
1961,On the State Assignment Problem for Sequential Machines. I.,"Abstract:
In this paper, the problem of determining economical state assignments for finite-state sequential machines is studied. The fundamental idea in this study is to find methods for selection of these assignments in which each binary variable describing the new state depends on as few variables of the old state as possible. In general, these variable assignments in which the dependence is reduced yield more economical implementation for the sequential machine than the assignments in which the dependence is not reduced. The main tool used in this study is the partition with the substitution property on the set of states of a sequential machine. It is shown that for a sequential machine the existence of assignments with reduced dependence is very closely connected with the existence of partitions with the substitution property on the set of states of the machine. It is shown how to determine these partitions for a given sequential machine and how they can be used to obtain assignments with reduced dependence."
1961,On the State Assignment Problem for Sequential Machines II.,"Abstract:
The object of this paper is to find state assignments for the internal states of a sequential machine such that the logical equations representing the machine are relatively simple. This is done by finding assignments for which the computation of a particular state variable depends only on the previous values of a small subset of the variables. The chief tool is the concept of a partition pair, which describes (loosely speaking) the information going into and resulting from the evaluation of a state variable. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of assignments with reduced dependence is found in terms of these pairs, and their algebraic properties are worked out so that they can be handled and generated. It is shown that the same methods can also be used to find input and output assignments with reduced dependence. The case of ``don't care'' conditions is considered and the theory is seen to apply, except that the failure of an algebraic property makes it weaker."
1960,Symbolic Analysis of a Decomposition of Information Processing Machines.,"In this paper we study the problem of replacing (decomposing) a complex finite state sequential machine by several simpler ones which operate in parallel and yield the same result. In the first part, we give the necessary mathematical background and results. In the second part, we apply these results and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decomposition for a given machine. If a decomposition exists then the required simpler machines which have to be connected in parallel are given."
1959,The Applications of Some Basic Inequalities for Entropy.,"This paper is part of a general study of efficient information selection, storage and processing. It is assumed that the information is contained in binary time series generated by a stochastic source. The main problem is to determine how to approximate the statistical properties of this information source by lower order probability distributions.
First, it is determined what restrictions are imposed by known lower order probability distributions on the higher order distributions which are to be determined or estimated. This study suggests an optimal way to estimate the higher order distributions.
In the second part the entropy changes which occur in going from lower to higher order probability distributions are studied. The upper and lower bounds for the entropy of the higher order distributions are computed in terms of the entropies of the lower order distributions. These results allow the computation of the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of the conditions which are imposed on the higher order distribution and are not induced by the lower order ones. From this one can compute the importance of knowing the higher order probability distributions for information processing. In conclusion, these results are applied to a coding problem to determine the delay required before encoding a message in order to achieve a prescribed fraction of the optimal comparison given by Shannon's coding theorem."
