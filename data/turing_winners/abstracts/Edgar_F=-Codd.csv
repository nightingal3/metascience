2009,"Derivability, redundancy and consistency of relations stored in large data banks.","The large, integrated data banks of the future will contain many relations of various degrees in stored form. It will not be unusual for this set of stored relations to be redundant. Two types of redundancy are defined and discussed. One type may be employed to improve accessibility of certain kinds of information which happen to be in great demand. When either type of redundancy exists, those responsible for control of the data bank should know about it and have some means of detecting any ""logical"" inconsistencies in the total set of stored relations. Consistency checking might be helpful in tracking down unauthorized (and possibly fraudulent) changes in the data bank contents."

1987,More Commentary on Missing Information in Relational Databases (Applicable and Inapplicable Information).,"My earlier paper TRI/EFC-4 from The Relational Institute on this subject was published in ACM SIGMOD Record, December 1986. As a result, I have received several comments and proposed changes. The purpose of this paper is to respond to these items, while continuing to place heavy emphasis on the semantic aspects of missing information. The response is principally further explanation, but a few changes of a quite minor character are proposed. In this paper the reader is assumed to have read TRI/EFC-4."
1986,Missing Information (Applicable and Inapplicable) in Relational Databases.,"There has been some technical and justified criticism of the treatment of missing information in the data sublanguage SQL and in IBM's Database 2 system (a relational database management system). Some of this criticism has been directed (by mistake) at the relational model. The purpose of this paper is to clarify and extend the treatment of missing information by the relational model. The clarification places heavy emphasis on the semantic aspects of missing information. The extension, which is relatively minor, provides a systematic approach (independent of data type) to dealing with the inapplicability of certain properties to some objects. This extension does not invalidate any part of the present version of the relational model."
1986,An Evaluation Scheme for Database Management Systems that are claimed to be Relational.,"Abstract:
This article offers basic principles for use in determining how ""relational"" a DBMS product is ‚Äî a challenge which faces many buyers today, because almost every vendor is claiming that his DBMS product is ""relational"". The material is likely to be of interest to vendors also. Some of them may not realize how far from the mark they are."
1983,A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks (Reprint).,"Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model."
1982,Relational Database: A Practical Foundation for Productivity.,"It is well known that the growth in demands from end users for new applications is outstripping the capability of data processing departments to implement the corresponding application programs. There are two complementary approaches to attacking this problem (and both approaches are needed): one is to put end users into direct touch with the information stored in computers; the other is to increase the productivity of data processing professionals in the development of application programs. It is less well known that a single technology, relational database management, provides a practical foundation for both approaches. It is explained why this is so. While developing this productivity theme, it is noted that the time has come to draw a very sharp line between relational and non-relational databse systems, so that the label ""relational"" will not be used in misleading ways. The key to drawing this line is something called a ""relational processing capability"". "

1980,Data Models in Database Management.,"It is a combination of three components: 1) a collection of data structure types (the building blocks of any database that conforms to the model); 2) a collection of operators or inferencing rules, which can be applied to any valid instances of the data types listed in (1), to retrieve or derive data from any parts of those structures in any combinations desired; 3) a collection of general integrity rules, which implicitly or explicitly define the set of consistent database states or changes of state or both‚Äîthese rules may sometimes be expressed as insert-update-delete rules."
1979,Extending the Database Relational Model to Capture More Meaning.,"During the last three or four years several investigators have been exploring ‚Äúsemantic models‚Äù for formatted databases. The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear. (1) the search for meaningful units that are as small as possible‚Äîatomic semantics; (2) the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usual n-ary relation‚Äîmolecular semantics. In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic operators."

1977,Access to relational data bases for a casual user.,"The goal of the RENDEZVOUS Project is to enable a casual user to access relational data bases in natural language without a preliminary training period. The system will, if necessary, engage in an English dialogue with the user in order to arrive at an unambiguous statement of his query. This dialogue serves the triple purpose of aiding the user in his problem specification, of clarifying ambiguities inherent in the English language and of enabling the system to overcome incomprehensible features of the users query. The conversation must constantly narrow the scope of inquiry, resorting to menu selection if necessary until the user and system come to an agreement as to what information has been requested. At any moment during the dialogue, the system must be capable of expressing its current understanding of the user's query in clear and unambiguous English. In particular, the system must be able to rephrase the user's query for approval before execution."

1975,Data base management.,"Data base management is in a state of ferment due to the emergence within the past few years of many new requirements. Amongst these requirements are the need to make application programs and terminal activities much more independent of the internal representation of data in storage, and the need to support:
1. many different kinds of end users at terminals (some interactions being of unpredictable scope and complexity);
2. greatly enhanced data security and privacy;
3. increased dynamic sharing of data (including concurrent update and enquiry);
4. networks of mutually remote data bases (including very high level data sublanguages for low bandwidth communication of requests)."

1974,Interactive Support for Non-Programmers: The Relational and Network Approaches.,"The objectives and strategies of the relational and network approaches are compared. The status of support for non-programming users is examined. General purpose support for such users entails provision of an augmented relationally complete retrieval capability without branching, explicit iteration, or cursors. It is clear how this capability can be realized with the relational approachówhether with a formal or informal language interface. It is not at all clear how the network approach can reach this goal, so long as the principal schema includes owner-coupled sets ìbearing information essentiallyî. A relational discipline is suggested as a way out for DBTG users."

1974,The Relational and Network Approaches: Comparison of the Application Programming Interfaces.,"For some time now there has been considerable debate in the field of database systems over the fundamental question of the underlying design philosophy of such a system. The controversy has centered on the structure of the programmer interface, though of course the design chosen for this interface has repercussions throughout the rest of the system. Two approaches to this problem have received particular attention: the network approach, which is typified by the proposals of the CODASYL Data Base Task Group (DBTG), and the relational approach, which is advocated by the present authors (among others). The purpose of this paper is to give some comparisons between these two approaches (primarily from the application programming viewpoint), and to show what the authors believe to be the advantages of the relational approach. The reader is assumed to have a basic familiarity with the two approaches."
1974,Seven Steps to Rendezvous with the Casual User.,"If we are to satisfy the needs of casual users of data bases, we must break through the barriers that presently prevent these users from freely employing their native languages (e.g. English) to specify what they want. In this paper we introduce an approach (already partially implemented) that permits a user to engage a relational database system in a dialog with the objective of attaining agreement between the user and the system as to the user's needs. The system allows this dialog to be in unrestricted English so long as it is able to extract a viable quantum of information from the user's response. Immediately the system finds that the user's response is inadequately decipherable or clearly inadequate, it confronts the user with a multiple choice question. As soon as possible, the conversation reverts to unrestricted English."

1962,Multiprogramming.,"Very few computer systems in existence today possess two or more processing units sharing a common set of core storage modules and input-output channels. The basic concern of multiprogramming is concurrency of operations within computer systems. Many different types of concurrency are incorporated in the computers in use today. Multiprogramming is defined as the technology associated with the concurrent execution of instructions, which are not restricted to being immediate neighbors in any instruction stream. The most common form of concurrency that is consistent with this definition is that of overlapping input-output (IO) operations with each other and with processing unit (PU) operations. The early contributions to this topic are discussed here. There exists today a wide variety of environments in which computer systems are required to operate. Many new types of computer organization are being developed to cope with these environments. Multiprogramming appears to serve different objectives in each. Common to all these objectives, however, is the basic objective of obtaining the maximum possible throughput rate. Minor variations of meaning are attached to ìthroughput rateî in different situations. Accordingly, this chapter examines several types of environment with a view for determining more specifically the role that multiprogramming plays in each. It is observed that much of the variation in the environments to be described is due to the different time scales upon which service is measured. Batch multiprogramming is discussed to fulfill two objectives: The optimizing objective is to minimize the execution time of the pending workload. The administrative objective is to shield the problem programmer, operating staff, and maintenance engineers from the complexities of concurrency. This chapter discusses the optimizing problem along with multiprogramming with two or more processing units.

1960,Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2: Introduction and Theory.,"In order to exploit fully a fast computer which possesses simultaneous processing abilities, it should to a large extent schedule its own workload. The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating. The construction of a schedule entails determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially with respect to each other. A concise scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize the time for executing the entire pending workload (or any subset of it), subject to external constraints such as precedence, urgency, etc. The algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines."
