2019,Equivalence of Equilibrium Propagation and Recurrent Backpropagation.,"Recurrent backpropagation and equilibrium propagation are supervised learning algorithms for fixed-point recurrent neural networks, which differ in their second phase. In the first phase, both algorithms converge to a fixed point that corresponds to the configuration where the prediction is made. In the second phase, equilibrium propagation relaxes to another nearby fixed point corresponding to smaller prediction error, whereas recurrent backpropagation uses a side network to compute error derivatives iteratively. In this work, we establish a close connection between these two algorithms. We show that at every moment in the second phase, the temporal derivatives of the neural activities in equilibrium propagation are equal to the error derivatives computed iteratively by recurrent backpropagation in the side network. This work shows that it is not required to have a side network for the computation of error derivatives and supports the hypothesis that in biological neural networks, temporal derivatives of neural activities may code for error signals.

2019,Gated Orthogonal Recurrent Units: On Learning to Forget.,"We present a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)–based model that combines the remembering ability of unitary evolution RNNs with the ability of gated RNNs to effectively forget redundant or irrelevant information in its memory. We achieve this by extending restricted orthogonal evolution RNNs with a gating mechanism similar to gated recurrent unit RNNs with a reset gate and an update gate. Our model is able to outperform long short-term memory, gated recurrent units, and vanilla unitary or orthogonal RNNs on several long-term-dependency benchmark tasks. We empirically show that both orthogonal and unitary RNNs lack the ability to forget. This ability plays an important role in RNNs. We provide competitive results along with an analysis of our model on many natural sequential tasks, including question answering, speech spectrum prediction, character-level language modeling, and synthetic tasks that involve long-term dependencies such as algorithmic, denoising, and copying tasks.

2019,Depth with nonlinearity creates no bad local minima in ResNets.,"Abstract
In this paper, we prove that depth with nonlinearity creates no bad local minima in a type of arbitrarily deep ResNets with arbitrary nonlinear activation functions, in the sense that the values of all local minima are no worse than the global minimum value of corresponding classical machine-learning models, and are guaranteed to further improve via residual representations. As a result, this paper provides an affirmative answer to an open question stated in a paper in the conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2018. This paper advances the optimization theory of deep learning only for ResNets and not for other network architectures."
2019,Towards Non-Saturating Recurrent Units for Modelling Long-Term Dependencies.,"Abstract
Modelling long-term dependencies is a challenge for recurrent neural networks. This is primarily due to the fact that gradients vanish during training, as the sequence length increases. Gradients can be attenuated by transition operators and are attenuated or dropped by activation functions. Canonical architectures like LSTM alleviate this issue by skipping information through a memory mechanism. We propose a new recurrent architecture (Non-saturating Recurrent Unit; NRU) that relies on a memory mechanism but forgoes both saturating activation functions and saturating gates, in order to further alleviate vanishing gradients. In a series of synthetic and real world tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed model is the only model that performs among the top 2 models across all tasks with and without long-term dependencies, when compared against a range of other architectures."
2019,Combined Reinforcement Learning via Abstract Representations.,"In the quest for efficient and robust reinforcement learning methods, both model-free and model-based approaches offer advantages. In this paper we propose a new way of explicitly bridging both approaches via a shared low-dimensional learned encoding of the environment, meant to capture summarizing abstractions. We show that the modularity brought by this approach leads to good generalization while being computationally efficient, with planning happening in a smaller latent state space. In addition, this approach recovers a sufficient low-dimensional representation of the environment, which opens up new strategies for interpretable AI, exploration and transfer learning.

2019,Do Neural Dialog Systems Use the Conversation History Effectively? An Empirical Study.,"Abstract
Neural generative models have been become increasingly popular when building conversational agents. They offer flexibility, can be easily adapted to new domains, and require minimal domain engineering. A common criticism of these systems is that they seldom understand or use the available dialog history effectively. In this paper, we take an empirical approach to understanding how these models use the available dialog history by studying the sensitivity of the models to artificially introduced unnatural changes or perturbations to their context at test time. We experiment with 10 different types of perturbations on 4 multi-turn dialog datasets and find that commonly used neural dialog architectures like recurrent and transformer-based seq2seq models are rarely sensitive to most perturbations such as missing or reordering utterances, shuffling words, etc. Also, by open-sourcing our code, we believe that it will serve as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating dialog systems in the future."
2019,Interpolated Adversarial Training: Achieving Robust Neural Networks Without Sacrificing Too Much Accuracy.,"Adversarial robustness has become a central goal in deep learning, both in theory and in practice. However, successful methods to improve the adversarial robustness (such as adversarial training) greatly hurt generalization performance on the unperturbed data. This could have a major impact on how achieving adversarial robustness affects real world systems (i.e. many may opt to forego robustness if it can improve accuracy on the unperturbed data). We propose Interpolated Adversarial Training, which employs recently proposed interpolation based training methods in the framework of adversarial training. On CIFAR-10, adversarial training increases the standard test error (when there is no adversary) from 4.43% to 12.32%, whereas with our Interpolated adversarial training we retain adversarial robustness while achieving a standard test error of only 6.45%. With our technique, the relative increase in the standard error for the robust model is reduced from 178.1% to just 45.5%.

2019,Interactive Language Learning by Question Answering.,"Abstract
Humans observe and interact with the world to acquire knowledge. However, most existing machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks miss the interactive, information-seeking component of comprehension. Such tasks present models with static documents that contain all necessary information, usually concentrated in a single short substring. Thus, models can achieve strong performance through simple word- and phrase-based pattern matching. We address this problem by formulating a novel text-based question answering task: Question Answering with Interactive Text (QAit). In QAit, an agent must interact with a partially observable text-based environment to gather information required to answer questions. QAit poses questions about the existence, location, and attributes of objects found in the environment. The data is built using a text-based game generator that defines the underlying dynamics of interaction with the environment. We propose and evaluate a set of baseline models for the QAit task that includes deep reinforcement learning agents. Experiments show that the task presents a major challenge for machine reading systems, while humans solve it with relative ease."
2019,How Transferable Are Features in Convolutional Neural Network Acoustic Models across Languages?,"Abstract:
Characterization of the representations learned in intermediate layers of deep networks can provide valuable insight into the nature of a task and can guide the development of well-tailored learning strategies. Here we study convolutional neural network (CNN)-based acoustic models in the context of automatic speech recognition. Adapting a method proposed by [1], we measure the transferability of each layer between English, Dutch and German to assess their language-specificity. We observed three distinct regions of transferability: (1) the first two layers were entirely transferable between languages, (2) layers 2-8 were also highly transferable but we found some evidence of language specificity, (3) the subsequent fully connected layers were more language specific but could be successfully finetuned to the target language. To further probe the effect of weight freezing, we performed follow-up experiments using freeze-training [2]. Our results are consistent with the observation that CNNs converge `bottom up' during training and demonstrate the benefit of freeze training, especially for transfer learning."
2019,A Highly Adaptive Acoustic Model for Accurate Multi-dialect Speech Recognition.,"Abstract:
Despite the success of deep learning in speech recognition, multi-dialect speech recognition remains a difficult problem. Although dialect-specific acoustic models are known to perform well in general, they are not easy to maintain when dialect-specific data is scarce and the number of dialects for each language is large. Therefore, a single unified acoustic model (AM) that generalizes well for many dialects has been in demand. In this paper, we propose a novel acoustic modeling technique for accurate multi-dialect speech recognition with a single AM. Our proposed AM is dynamically adapted based on both dialect information and its internal representation, which results in a highly adaptive AM for handling multiple dialects simultaneously. We also propose a simple but effective training method to deal with unseen dialects. The experimental results on large scale speech datasets show that the proposed AM outperforms all the previous ones, reducing word error rates (WERs) by 8.11% relative compared to a single all-dialects AM and by 7.31% relative compared to dialect-specific AMs."
2019,Representation Mixing for TTS Synthesis.,"Abstract:
Recent character and phoneme-based parametric TTS systems using deep learning have shown strong performance in natural speech generation. However, the choice between character or phoneme input can create serious limitations for practical deployment, as direct control of pronunciation is crucial in certain cases. We demonstrate a simple method for combining multiple types of linguistic information in a single encoder, named representation mixing, enabling flexible choice between character, phoneme, or mixed representations during inference. Experiments and user studies on a public audiobook corpus show the efficacy of our approach."
2019,The Pytorch-kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit.,"Abstract:
The availability of open-source software is playing a remarkable role in the popularization of speech recognition and deep learning. Kaldi, for instance, is nowadays an established framework used to develop state-of-the-art speech recognizers. PyTorch is used to build neural networks with the Python language and has recently spawn tremendous interest within the machine learning community thanks to its simplicity and flexibility. The PyTorch-Kaldi project aims to bridge the gap between these popular toolkits, trying to inherit the efficiency of Kaldi and the flexibility of PyTorch. PyTorch-Kaldi is not only a simple interface between these software, but it embeds several useful features for developing modern speech recognizers. For instance, the code is specifically designed to naturally plug-in user-defined acoustic models. As an alternative, users can exploit several pre-implemented neural networks that can be customized using intuitive configuration files. PyTorch-Kaldi supports multiple feature and label streams as well as combinations of neural networks, enabling the use of complex neural architectures. The toolkit is publicly-released along with a rich documentation and is designed to properly work locally or on HPC clusters. Experiments, that are conducted on several datasets and tasks, show that PyTorch-Kaldi can effectively be used to develop modern state-of-the-art speech recognizers."
2019,BabyAI: A Platform to Study the Sample Efficiency of Grounded Language Learning.,"Allowing humans to interactively train artificial agents to understand language instructions is desirable for both practical and scientific reasons.  Though, given  the lack of sample efficiency in current learning methods, reaching this goal may require substantial research efforts. We introduce the BabyAI research platform, with the goal of supporting investigations towards including humans in the loop for grounded language learning. The BabyAI platform comprises an extensible suite of 19 levels of increasing difficulty. Each level gradually leads the agent towards acquiring a combinatorially rich synthetic language, which is a proper subset of English. The platform also provides a hand-crafted bot agent, which simulates a human teacher.  We report estimated amount of supervision required for training neural reinforcement and behavioral-cloning agents on some BabyAI levels. We put forward strong evidence that current deep learning methods are not yet sufficiently sample-efficient in the context of learning a language with compositional properties."
2019,Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Stable Brain-Machine Interfaces.,"Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable option
to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based on the
ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals recorded
using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor cortices of the
brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded neurons requires repeated
recalibrations of the interface, which can potentially alter the day-to-day
user experience. The resulting need for continued user adaptation interferes with
the natural, subconscious use of the BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational
approach that decodes movement intent from a low-dimensional latent representation
of the neural data. We implement various domain adaptation methods
to stabilize the interface over significantly long times. This includes Canonical
Correlation Analysis used to align the latent variables across days; this method
requires prior point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains.
Alternatively, we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables
across days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence.
These two methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance
of the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain
Adaptation Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the
residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based
on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the domain
adaptation problem."
2019,Recall Traces: Backtracking Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning.,"In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward.  In these cases, few of the interactions with the environment provide a relevant learning signal. Hence, we may want to preferentially train on those high-reward states and the probable trajectories leading to them. 
To this end, we advocate for the use of a \textit{backtracking model} that predicts the preceding states that terminate at a given high-reward state.  We can train a model which, starting from a high value state (or one that is estimated to have high value), predicts and samples which (state, action)-tuples may have led to that high value state. These traces of (state, action) pairs, which we refer to as Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value state, are informative as they terminate in good states, and hence we can use these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples from an approximate posterior distribution over trajectories which lead to large rewards. Our method improves the sample efficiency of both on- and off-policy RL algorithms across several environments and tasks.  "
2019,InfoBot: Transfer and Exploration via the Information Bottleneck.,"A central challenge in reinforcement learning is discovering effective policies for tasks where rewards are sparsely distributed. We postulate that in the absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should seek out {\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the state space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored regions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By training a goal-conditioned model with an information bottleneck, we can identify decision states by examining where the model accesses the goal state through the bottleneck. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision states, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the sensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this model can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the agent through a sequence of potential decision  states and through new regions of the state space."
2019,Learning deep representations by mutual information estimation and maximization.,"This work investigates unsupervised learning of representations by maximizing mutual information between an input and the output of a deep neural network encoder. Importantly, we show that structure matters: incorporating knowledge about locality in the input into the objective can significantly improve a representation's suitability for downstream tasks. We further control characteristics of the representation by matching to a prior distribution adversarially. Our method, which we call Deep InfoMax (DIM), outperforms a number of popular unsupervised learning methods and compares favorably with fully-supervised learning on several classification tasks in with some standard architectures. DIM opens new avenues for unsupervised learning of representations and is an important step towards flexible formulations of representation learning objectives for specific end-goals."
2019,On the Relation Between the Sharpest Directions of DNN Loss and the SGD Step Length.,"The training of deep neural networks with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a large learning rate or a small batch-size typically ends in flat regions of the weight space, as indicated by small eigenvalues of the Hessian of the training loss. This was found to correlate with a good final generalization performance.  In this paper we extend previous work by investigating the curvature of the loss surface along the whole training trajectory, rather than only at the endpoint. We find that initially SGD visits increasingly sharp regions, reaching a maximum sharpness determined by both the learning rate and the batch-size of SGD. At this peak value SGD starts to fail to minimize the loss along directions in the loss surface corresponding to the largest curvature (sharpest directions). To further investigate the effect of these dynamics in the training process, we study a variant of SGD using a reduced learning rate along the sharpest directions which we show can improve training speed while finding both sharper and better generalizing solution, compared to vanilla SGD. Overall, our results show that the SGD dynamics in the subspace of the sharpest directions influence the regions that SGD steers to (where larger learning rate or smaller batch size result in wider regions visited), the overall training speed, and the generalization ability of the final model."
2019,h-detach: Modifying the LSTM Gradient Towards Better Optimization.,"Recurrent neural networks are known for their notorious exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP). This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because EVGP prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (\textit{h}-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies (which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent LSTMs from capturing them. Our algorithm\footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/bhargav104/h-detach.} prevents gradients flowing through this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such dependencies better. We show significant improvements over vanilla LSTM gradient based training in terms of convergence speed, robustness to seed and learning rate, and generalization using our modification of LSTM gradient on various benchmark datasets."
2019,Modeling the Long Term Future in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning.,"In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent interleaves between model learning and planning.  These two components are  inextricably intertwined. If the model is not able to provide sensible long-term prediction, the executed planer would exploit model flaws, which can yield catastrophic failures. This paper focuses on building a model that reasons about the long-term future and demonstrates how to use this for efficient planning and exploration. To this end, we build a latent-variable autoregressive model by leveraging recent ideas in variational inference. We argue that forcing latent variables to carry future information through an auxiliary task substantially improves long-term predictions. Moreover, by planning in the latent space, the planner's solution is ensured to be within regions where the model is valid. An exploration strategy can be devised by searching for unlikely trajectories under the model. Our methods achieves higher reward faster compared to baselines on a variety of tasks and environments in both the imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning settings. "
2019,Quaternion Recurrent Neural Networks.,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful architectures to model sequential data, due to their capability to learn short and long-term dependencies between the basic elements of a sequence. Nonetheless, popular tasks such as speech or images recognition, involve multi-dimensional input features that are characterized by strong internal dependencies between the dimensions of the input vector. We propose a novel quaternion recurrent neural network (QRNN), alongside with a quaternion long-short term memory neural network (QLSTM), that take into account both the external relations and these internal structural dependencies with the quaternion algebra. Similarly to capsules, quaternions allow the QRNN to code internal dependencies by composing and processing multidimensional features as single entities, while the recurrent operation reveals correlations between the elements composing the sequence. We show that both QRNN and QLSTM achieve better performances than RNN and LSTM in a realistic application of automatic speech recognition. Finally, we show that QRNN and QLSTM reduce by a maximum factor of 3.3x the number of free parameters needed, compared to real-valued RNNs and LSTMs to reach better results, leading to a more compact representation of the relevant information."
2019,Probabilistic Planning with Sequential Monte Carlo methods.,"In this work, we propose a novel formulation of planning which views it as a probabilistic inference problem over future optimal trajectories. This enables us to use sampling methods, and thus, tackle planning in continuous domains using a fixed computational budget.   We design a new algorithm,  Sequential Monte Carlo Planning, by leveraging classical methods in Sequential Monte Carlo and Bayesian smoothing in the context of control as inference. Furthermore, we show that Sequential Monte Carlo Planning can capture multimodal policies and can quickly learn continuous control tasks."
2019,An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting during Deep Neural Network Learning.,"Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we investigate the learning dynamics of neural networks as they train on single classification tasks. Our goal is to understand whether a related phenomenon occurs when data does not undergo a clear distributional shift. We define a ``forgetting event'' to have occurred when an individual training example transitions from being classified correctly to incorrectly over the course of learning. Across several benchmark data sets, we find that: (i) certain examples are forgotten with high frequency, and some not at all; (ii) a data set's (un)forgettable examples generalize across neural architectures; and (iii) based on forgetting dynamics, a significant fraction of examples can be omitted from the training data set while still maintaining state-of-the-art generalization performance."
2019,Deep Graph Infomax.,"We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning."
2019,Perceptual Generative Autoencoders.,"A framework for training autoencoder-based generative models, with non-adversarial losses and unrestricted neural network architectures."
2019,State-Reification Networks: Improving Generalization by Modeling the Distribution of Hidden Representations.,"Machine learning promises methods that generalize well from finite labeled data. However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as _state reification_, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training."
2019,GMNN: Graph Markov Neural Networks.,"This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational data, which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results."
2019,On the Spectral Bias of Neural Networks.,"Neural networks are known to be a class of highly expressive functions able to fit even random input-output mappings with 100% accuracy. In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we highlight a learning bias of deep networks towards low frequency functions â€“ i.e. functions that vary globally without local fluctuations â€“ which manifests itself as a frequency-dependent learning speed. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity."
2019,Manifold Mixup: Better Representations by Interpolating Hidden States.,"Deep neural networks excel at learning the training data, but often provide incorrect and confident predictions when evaluated on slightly different test examples. This includes distribution shifts, outliers, and adversarial examples. To address these issues, we propose \manifoldmixup{}, a simple regularizer that encourages neural networks to predict less confidently on interpolations of hidden representations. \manifoldmixup{} leverages semantic interpolations as additional training signal, obtaining neural networks with smoother decision boundaries at multiple levels of representation. As a result, neural networks trained with \manifoldmixup{} learn flatter class-representations, that is, with fewer directions of variance. We prove theory on why this flattening happens under ideal conditions, validate it empirically on practical situations, and connect it to the previous works on information theory and generalization. In spite of incurring no significant computation and being implemented in a few lines of code, \manifoldmixup{} improves strong baselines in supervised learning, robustness to single-step adversarial attacks, and test log-likelihood."
2019,A Data-Efficient Framework for Training and Sim-to-Real Transfer of Navigation Policies.,"Abstract:
Learning effective visuomotor policies for robots purely from data is challenging, but also appealing since a learning-based system should not require manual tuning or calibration. In the case of a robot operating in a real environment the training process can be costly, time-consuming, and even dangerous since failures are common at the start of training. For this reason, it is desirable to be able to leverage simulation and off-policy data to the extent possible to train the robot. In this work, we introduce a robust framework that plans in simulation and transfers well to the real environment. Our model incorporates a gradient-descent based planning module, which, given the initial image and goal image, encodes the images to a lower dimensional latent state and plans a trajectory to reach the goal. The model, consisting of the encoder and planner modules, is first trained through a meta-learning strategy in simulation. We subsequently perform adversarial domain transfer on the encoder by using a bank of unlabelled but random images from the simulation and real environments to enable the encoder to map images from the real and simulated environments to a similarly distributed latent representation. By fine tuning the entire model (encoder + planner) with only a few real world expert demonstrations, we show successful planning performances in different navigation tasks."
2019,Interpolation Consistency Training for Semi-supervised Learning.,"We introduce Interpolation Consistency Training (ICT), a simple and computation efficient algorithm for training Deep Neural Networks in the semi-supervised learning paradigm. ICT encourages the prediction at an interpolation of unlabeled points to be consistent with the interpolation of the predictions at those points. In classification problems, ICT moves the decision boundary to low-density regions of the data distribution. Our experiments show that ICT achieves state-of-the-art performance when applied to standard neural network architectures on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmark dataset."
2019,InfoMask: Masked Variational Latent Representation to Localize Chest Disease.,"Abstract
The scarcity of richly annotated medical images is limiting supervised deep learning based solutions to medical image analysis tasks, such as localizing discriminatory radiomic disease signatures. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage unsupervised and weakly supervised models. Most recent weakly supervised localization methods apply attention maps or region proposals in a multiple instance learning formulation. While attention maps can be noisy, leading to erroneously highlighted regions, it is not simple to decide on an optimal window/bag size for multiple instance learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned spatial masking mechanism to filter out irrelevant background signals from attention maps. The proposed method minimizes mutual information between a masked variational representation and the input while maximizing the information between the masked representation and class labels. This results in more accurate localization of discriminatory regions. We tested the proposed model on the ChestX-ray8 dataset to localize pneumonia from chest X-ray images without using any pixel-level or bounding-box annotations."
2018,Deep convolutional networks for quality assessment of protein folds.,"Motivation
The computational prediction of a protein structure from its sequence generally relies on a method to assess the quality of protein models. Most assessment methods rank candidate models using heavily engineered structural features, defined as complex functions of the atomic coordinates. However, very few methods have attempted to learn these features directly from the data.

Results
We show that deep convolutional networks can be used to predict the ranking of model structures solely on the basis of their raw three-dimensional atomic densities, without any feature tuning. We develop a deep neural network that performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The network is trained on decoys from the CASP7 to CASP10 datasets and its performance is tested on the CASP11 dataset. Additional testing on decoys from the CASP12, CAMEO and 3DRobot datasets confirms that the network performs consistently well across a variety of protein structures. While the network learns to assess structural decoys globally and does not rely on any predefined features, it can be analyzed to show that it implicitly identifies regions that deviate from the native structure."
2018,Fine-grained attention mechanism for neural machine translation.,"Abstract
Neural machine translation (NMT) has been a new paradigm in machine translation, and the attention mechanism has become the dominant approach with the state-of-the-art records in many language pairs. While there are variants of the attention mechanism, all of them use only temporal attention where one scalar value is assigned to one context vector corresponding to a source word. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained (or 2D) attention mechanism where each dimension of a context vector will receive a separate attention score. In experiments with the task of En-De and En-Fi translation, the fine-grained attention method improves the translation quality in terms of BLEU score. In addition, our alignment analysis reveals how the fine-grained attention mechanism exploits the internal structure of context vectors."
2018,Learning normalized inputs for iterative estimation in medical image segmentation.,"
Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet powerful pipeline for medical image segmentation that combines Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks (FC-ResNets). We propose and examine a design that takes particular advantage of recent advances in the understanding of both Convolutional Neural Networks as well as ResNets. Our approach focuses upon the importance of a trainable pre-processing when using FC-ResNets and we show that a low-capacity FCN model can serve as a pre-processor to normalize medical input data. In our image segmentation pipeline, we use FCNs to obtain normalized images, which are then iteratively refined by means of a FC-ResNet to generate a segmentation prediction. As in other fully convolutional approaches, our pipeline can be used off-the-shelf on different image modalities. We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to other 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver lesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying our 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we reach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods. The obtained results illustrate the strong potential and versatility of the pipeline by achieving accurate segmentations on a variety of image modalities and different anatomical regions.

2018,Dynamic Neural Turing Machine with Continuous and Discrete Addressing Schemes.,"We extend the neural Turing machine (NTM) model into a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing trainable address vectors. This addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of location-based addressing strategies, including both linear and nonlinear ones. We implement the D-NTM with both continuous and discrete read and write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects of learning to read and write into a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU controller. We provide extensive analysis of our model and compare different variations of neural Turing machines on this task. We show that our model outperforms long short-term memory and NTM variants. We provide further experimental results on the sequential MNIST, Stanford Natural Language Inference, associative recall, and copy tasks.

2018,Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network.,"Abstract:
Recent deep learning based approaches have achieved great success on handwriting recognition. Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network (RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters."
2018,Light Gated Recurrent Units for Speech Recognition.,"Abstract:
A field that has directly benefited from the recent advances in deep learning is automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness, modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in processing speech signals. In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely, gated recurrent units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is twofold: First, we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with rectified linear unit activations. This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues. Results show that the proposed architecture, called light GRU, not only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU, but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks, input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms, ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end connectionist temporal classification models."
2018,Gated Orthogonal Recurrent Units: On Learning to Forget.,"We present a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) based model that combines the remembering ability of unitary RNNs with the ability of gated RNNs to effectively forget redundant/irrelevant information in its memory. We achieve this by extending unitary RNNs with a gating mechanism. Our model is able to outperform LSTMs, GRUs and Unitary RNNs on several long-term dependency benchmark tasks. We empirically both show the orthogonal/unitary RNNs lack the ability to forget and also the ability of GORU to simultaneously remember long term dependencies while forgetting irrelevant information. This plays an important role in recurrent neural networks. We provide competitive results along with an analysis of our model on many natural sequential tasks including the bAbI Question Answering, TIMIT speech spectrum prediction, Penn TreeBank, and synthetic tasks that involve long-term dependencies such as algorithmic, parenthesis, denoising and copying tasks."
2018,Neural Models for Key Phrase Extraction and Question Generation.,"Abstract
We propose a two-stage neural model to tackle question generation from documents. First, our model estimates the probability that word sequences in a document are ones that a human would pick when selecting candidate answers by training a neural key-phrase extractor on the answers in a question-answering corpus. Predicted key phrases then act as target answers and condition a sequence-to-sequence question-generation model with a copy mechanism. Empirically, our key-phrase extraction model significantly outperforms an entity-tagging baseline and existing rule-based approaches. We further demonstrate that our question generation system formulates fluent, answerable questions from key phrases. This two-stage system could be used to augment or generate reading comprehension datasets, which may be leveraged to improve machine reading systems or in educational settings."
2018,Straight to the Tree: Constituency Parsing with Neural Syntactic Distance.,"Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel constituency parsing scheme. The model first predicts a real-valued scalar, named syntactic distance, for each split position in the sentence. The topology of grammar tree is then determined by the values of syntactic distances. Compared to traditional shift-reduce parsing schemes, our approach is free from the potentially disastrous compounding error. It is also easier to parallelize and much faster. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art single model F1 score of 92.1 on PTB and 86.4 on CTB dataset, which surpasses the previous single model results by a large margin."
2018,On the Iterative Refinement of Densely Connected Representation Levels for Semantic Segmentation.,"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches increase the receptive field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of poolings/strided convolutions or successive dilated convolutions. However, it is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1) downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3) coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer parameters."
2018,"HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering.","Abstract
Existing question answering (QA) datasets fail to train QA systems to perform complex reasoning and provide explanations for answers. We introduce HotpotQA, a new dataset with 113k Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs with four key features: (1) the questions require finding and reasoning over multiple supporting documents to answer; (2) the questions are diverse and not constrained to any pre-existing knowledge bases or knowledge schemas; (3) we provide sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, allowing QA systems to reason with strong supervision and explain the predictions; (4) we offer a new type of factoid comparison questions to test QA systemsâ€™ ability to extract relevant facts and perform necessary comparison. We show that HotpotQA is challenging for the latest QA systems, and the supporting facts enable models to improve performance and make explainable predictions."
2018,Width of Minima Reached by Stochastic Gradient Descent is Influenced by Learning Rate to Batch Size Ratio.,"Abstract
We show that the dynamics and convergence properties of SGD are set by the ratio of learning rate to batch size. We observe that this ratio is a key determinant of the generalization error, which we suggest is mediated by controlling the width of the final minima found by SGD. We verify our analysis experimentally on a range of deep neural networks and datasets."
2018,Monaural Singing Voice Separation with Skip-Filtering Connections and Recurrent Inference of Time-Frequency Mask.,"Abstract:
Singing voice separation based on deep learning relies on the usage of time-frequency masking. In many cases the masking process is not a learnable function or is not encapsulated into the deep learning optimization. Consequently, most of the existing methods rely on a post processing step using the generalized Wiener filtering. This work proposes a method that learns and optimizes (during training) a source-dependent mask and does not need the aforementioned post processing step. We introduce a recurrent inference algorithm, a sparse transformation step to improve the mask generation process, and a learned denoising filter. Obtained results show an increase of 0.49 dB for the signal to distortion ratio and 0.30 dB for the signal to interference ratio, compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for monaural singing voice separation."
2018,Dynamic Frame Skipping for Fast Speech Recognition in Recurrent Neural Network Based Acoustic Models.,"Abstract:
A recurrent neural network is a powerful tool for modeling sequential data such as text and speech. While recurrent neural networks have achieved record-breaking results in speech recognition, one remaining challenge is their slow processing speed. The main cause comes from the nature of recurrent neural networks that read only one frame at each time step. Therefore, reducing the number of reads is an effective approach to reducing processing time. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture called Skip-RNN, which dynamically skips speech frames that are less important. The Skip-RNN consists of an acoustic model network and skip-policy network that are jointly trained to classify speech frames and determine how many frames to skip. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Wall Street Journal corpus and show that it can accelerate acoustic model computation by up to 2.4 times without any noticeable degradation in transcription accuracy."
2018,Towards End-to-end Spoken Language Understanding.,"Abstract:
Spoken language understanding system is traditionally designed as a pipeline of a number of components. First, the audio signal is processed by an automatic speech recognizer for transcription or n-best hypotheses. With the recognition results, a natural language understanding system classifies the text to structured data as domain, intent and slots for down-streaming consumers, such as dialog system, hands-free applications. These components are usually developed and optimized independently. In this paper, we present our study on an end-to-end learning system for spoken language understanding. With this unified approach, we can infer the semantic meaning directly from audio features without the intermediate text representation. This study showed that the trained model can achieve reasonable good result and demonstrated that the model can capture the semantic attention directly from the audio features."
2018,Boundary Seeking GANs.,"Generative adversarial networks are a learning framework that rely on training a discriminator to estimate a measure of difference between a target and generated distributions. GANs, as normally formulated, rely on the generated samples being completely differentiable w.r.t. the generative parameters, and thus do not work for discrete data. We introduce a method for training GANs with discrete data that uses the estimated difference measure from the discriminator to compute importance weights for generated samples, thus providing a policy gradient for training the generator. The importance weights have a strong connection to the decision boundary of the discriminator, and we call our method boundary-seeking GANs (BGANs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with discrete image and character-based natural language generation.  In addition, the boundary-seeking objective extends to continuous data, which can be used to improve stability of training, and we demonstrate this on Celeba, Large-scale Scene Understanding (LSUN) bedrooms, and Imagenet without conditioning."
2018,Residual Connections Encourage Iterative Inference.,"Residual networks (Resnets) have become a prominent architecture in deep learning. However, a comprehensive understanding of Resnets is still a topic of ongoing research. A recent view argues that Resnets perform iterative refinement of features. We attempt to further expose properties of this aspect. To this end, we study Resnets both analytically and empirically. We formalize the notion of iterative refinement in Resnets by showing that residual architectures naturally encourage features to move along the negative gradient of loss during the feedforward phase. In addition, our empirical analysis suggests that Resnets are able to perform both representation learning and iterative refinement. In general, a Resnet block tends to concentrate representation learning behavior in the first few layers while higher layers perform iterative refinement of features. Finally we observe that sharing residual layers naively leads to representation explosion and hurts generalization performance, and show that simple existing strategies can help alleviating this problem."
2018,Finding Flatter Minima with SGD.,"It has been discussed that over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with smaller batch sizes generalize better compared with those trained with larger batch sizes. Additionally, model parameters found by small batch size SGD tend to be in flatter regions. We extend these empirical observations and experimentally show that both large learning rate and small batch size contribute towards SGD finding flatter minima that generalize well. Conversely, we find that small learning rates and large batch sizes lead to sharper minima that correlate with poor generalization in DNNs."
2018,FigureQA: An Annotated Figure Dataset for Visual Reasoning.,"We introduce FigureQA, a visual reasoning corpus of over one million question-answer pairs grounded in over 100,000 images. The images are synthetic, scientific-style figures from five classes: line plots, dot-line plots, vertical and horizontal bar graphs, and pie charts. We formulate our reasoning task by generating questions from 15 templates; questions concern various relationships between plot elements and examine characteristics like the maximum, the minimum, area-under-the-curve, smoothness, and intersection. To resolve, such questions often require reference to multiple plot elements and synthesis of information distributed spatially throughout a figure. To facilitate the training of machine learning systems, the corpus also includes side data that can be used to formulate auxiliary objectives. In particular, we provide the numerical data used to generate each figure as well as bounding-box annotations for all plot elements. We study the proposed visual reasoning task by training several models, including the recently proposed Relation Network as a strong baseline. Preliminary results indicate that the task poses a significant machine learning challenge. We envision FigureQA as a first step towards developing models that can intuitively recognize patterns from visual representations of data."
2018,Universal Successor Representations for Transfer Reinforcement Learning.,"The objective of transfer reinforcement learning is to generalize from a set of previous tasks to unseen new tasks. In this work, we focus on the transfer scenario where the dynamics among tasks are the same, but their goals differ. Although general value function (Sutton et al., 2011) has been shown to be useful for knowledge transfer, learning a universal value function can be challenging in practice. To attack this, we propose (1) to use universal successor representations (USR) to represent the transferable knowledge and (2) a USR approximator (USRA) that can be trained by interacting with the environment. Our experiments show that USR can be effectively applied to new tasks, and the agent initialized by the trained USRA can achieve the goal considerably faster than random initialization."
2018,Extending the Framework of Equilibrium Propagation to General Dynamics.,"The biological plausibility of the backpropagation algorithm has long been doubted by neuroscientists. Two major reasons are that neurons would need to send two different types of signal in the forward and backward phases, and that pairs of neurons would need to communicate through symmetric bidirectional connections.
We present a simple two-phase learning procedure for fixed point recurrent networks that addresses both these issues.
In our model, neurons perform leaky integration and synaptic weights are updated through a local mechanism.
Our learning method extends the framework of Equilibrium Propagation to general dynamics, relaxing the requirement of an energy function.
As a consequence of this generalization, the algorithm does not compute the true gradient of the objective function,
but rather approximates it at a precision which is proven to be directly related to the degree of symmetry of the feedforward and feedback weights.
We show experimentally that the intrinsic properties of the system lead to alignment of the feedforward and feedback weights, and that our algorithm optimizes the objective function."
2018,Twin Networks: Matching the Future for Sequence Generation.,"We propose a simple technique for encouraging generative RNNs to plan ahead. We train a ``backward'' recurrent network to generate a given sequence in reverse order, and we encourage states of the forward model to predict cotemporal states of the backward model. The backward network is used only during training, and plays no role during sampling or inference. We hypothesize that our approach eases modeling of long-term dependencies by implicitly forcing the forward states to hold information about the longer-term future (as contained in the backward states). We show empirically that our approach achieves 9% relative improvement for a speech recognition task, and achieves significant improvement on a COCO caption generation task."
2018,ChatPainter: Improving Text to Image Generation using Dialogue.,"Synthesizing realistic images from text descriptions on a dataset like Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO), where each image can contain several objects, is a challenging task. Prior work has used text captions to generate images. However, captions might not be informative enough to capture the entire image and insufficient for the model to be able to understand which objects in the images correspond to which words in the captions. We show that adding a dialogue that further describes the scene leads to significant improvement in the inception score and in the quality of generated images on the COCO dataset."
2018,Learning General Purpose Distributed Sentence Representations via Large Scale Multi-task Learning.,"A lot of the recent success in natural language processing (NLP) has been driven by distributed vector representations of words trained on large amounts of text in an unsupervised manner. These representations are typically used as general purpose features for words across a range of NLP problems. However, extending this success to learning representations of sequences of words, such as sentences, remains an open problem. Recent work has explored unsupervised as well as supervised learning techniques with different training objectives to learn general purpose fixed-length sentence representations. In this work, we present a simple, effective multi-task learning framework for sentence representations that combines the inductive biases of diverse training objectives in a single model. 
We train this model on several data sources with multiple training objectives on over 100 million sentences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sharing a single recurrent sentence encoder across weakly related tasks leads to consistent improvements over previous methods. We present substantial improvements in the context of transfer learning and low-resource settings using our learned general-purpose representations."
2018,Deep Complex Networks.,"At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech spectrum prediction using TIMIT. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks."
2018,Graph Attention Networks.,"We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of computationally intensive matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training)."
2018,Fraternal Dropout.,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are important class of architectures among neural networks useful for language modeling and sequential prediction. However, optimizing RNNs is known to be harder compared to feed-forward neural networks. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. In this paper we propose a simple technique called fraternal dropout that takes advantage of dropout to achieve this goal. Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout. We evaluate our model and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on two benchmark datasets - Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. We also show that our approach leads to performance improvement by a significant margin in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks."
2018,Mutual Information Neural Estimation.,"We argue that the estimation of mutual information between high dimensional continuous random variables can be achieved by gradient descent over neural networks. We present a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) that is linearly scalable in dimensionality as well as in sample size, trainable through back-prop, and strongly consistent. We present a handful of applications on which MINE can be used to minimize or maximize mutual information. We apply MINE to improve adversarially trained generative models. We also use MINE to implement the Information Bottleneck, applying it to supervised classification; our results demonstrate substantial improvement in flexibility and performance in these settings."
2018,Focused Hierarchical RNNs for Conditional Sequence Processing.,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms have obtained state-of-the-art results for many sequence processing tasks. Most of these models use a simple form of encoder with attention that looks over the entire sequence and assigns a weight to each token independently. We present a mechanism for focusing RNN encoders for sequence modelling tasks which allows them to attend to key parts of the input as needed. We formulate this using a multi-layer conditional hierarchical sequence encoder that reads in one token at a time and makes a discrete decision on whether the token is relevant to the context or question being asked. The discrete gating mechanism takes in the context embedding and the current hidden state as inputs and controls information flow into the layer above. We train it using policy gradient methods. We evaluate this method on several types of tasks with different attributes. First, we evaluate the method on synthetic tasks which allow us to evaluate the model for its generalization ability and probe the behavior of the gates in more controlled settings. We then evaluate this approach on large scale Question Answering tasks including the challenging MS MARCO and SearchQA tasks. Our models shows consistent improvements for both tasks over prior work and our baselines. It has also shown to generalize significantly better on synthetic tasks as compared to the baselines."
2018,MaD TwinNet: Masker-Denoiser Architecture with Twin Networks for Monaural Sound Source Separation.,"Abstract:
Monaural singing voice separation task focuses on the prediction of the singing voice from a single channel music mixture signal. Current state of the art (SOTA) results in monaural singing voice separation are obtained with deep learning based methods. In this work we present a novel recurrent neural approach that learns long-term temporal patterns and structures of a musical piece. We build upon the recently proposed Masker-Denoiser (MaD) architecture and we enhance it with the Twin Networks, a technique to regularize a recurrent generative network using a backward running copy of the network. We evaluate our method using the Demixing Secret Dataset and we obtain an increment to signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) of 0.37 dB and to signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of 0.23 dB, compared to previous SOTA results."
2018,Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition.,"Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies and to solve many tasks with less learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network (QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model. Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on real-valued CNNs.
"
2018,Twin Regularization for Online Speech Recognition.,"Online speech recognition is crucial for developing natural human-machine interfaces. This modality, however, is significantly more challenging than off-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use of future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust predictions. A popular solution to mitigate this issue consists of feeding neural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames. This introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead features. This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the future rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden representations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful information about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called Twin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states to be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a ""twin"" neural network running backwards in time. The experiments, conducted on a number of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features and acoustic conditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important advantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at test time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks.
"
2018,Image-to-image translation for cross-domain disentanglement.,"Deep image translation methods have recently shown excellent results, outputting high-quality images covering multiple modes of the data distribution. There has also been increased interest in disentangling the internal representations learned by deep methods to further improve their performance and achieve a finer control. In this paper, we bridge these two objectives and introduce the concept of cross-domain disentanglement. We aim to separate the internal representation into three parts. The shared part contains information for both domains. The exclusive parts, on the other hand, contain only factors of variation that are particular to each domain. We achieve this through bidirectional image translation based on Generative Adversarial Networks and cross-domain autoencoders, a novel network component. Our model offers multiple advantages. We can output diverse samples covering multiple modes of the distributions of both domains, perform domain- specific image transfer and interpolation, and cross-domain retrieval without the need of labeled data, only paired images. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art in multi-modal image translation and achieve better results for translation on challenging datasets as well as for cross-domain retrieval on realistic datasets."
2018,MetaGAN: An Adversarial Approach to Few-Shot Learning.,"In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple and general framework called MetaGAN for few-shot learning problems. Most state-of-the-art few-shot classification models can be integrated with MetaGAN in a principled and straightforward way. By introducing an adversarial generator conditioned on tasks, we augment vanilla few-shot classification models with the ability to discriminate between real and fake data. We argue that this GAN-based approach can help few-shot classifiers to learn sharper decision boundary, which could generalize better. We show that with our MetaGAN framework, we can extend supervised few-shot learning models to naturally cope with unsupervised data. Different from previous work in semi-supervised few-shot learning, our algorithms can deal with semi-supervision at both sample-level and task-level. We give theoretical justifications of the strength of MetaGAN, and validate the effectiveness of MetaGAN on challenging few-shot image classification benchmarks."
2018,Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning.,"Due to the inherent model uncertainty, learning to infer Bayesian posterior from a few-shot dataset is an important step towards robust meta-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning method. The proposed method combines efficient gradient-based meta-learning with nonparametric variational inference in a principled probabilistic framework. Unlike previous methods, during fast adaptation, the method is capable of learning complex uncertainty structure beyond a simple Gaussian approximation, and during meta-update, a novel Bayesian mechanism prevents meta-level overfitting. Remaining a gradient-based method, it is also the first Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning method applicable to various tasks including reinforcement learning. Experiment results show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in sinusoidal regression, image classification, active learning, and reinforcement learning."
2018,Sparse Attentive Backtracking: Temporal Credit Assignment Through Reminding.,"Learning long-term dependencies in extended temporal sequences requires credit assignment to events far back in the past. The most common method for training recurrent neural networks, back-propagation through time (BPTT), requires credit information to be propagated backwards through every single step of the forward computation, potentially over thousands or millions of time steps. This becomes computationally expensive or even infeasible when used with long sequences. Importantly, biological brains are unlikely to perform such detailed reverse replay over very long sequences of internal states (consider days, months, or years.) However, humans are often reminded of past memories or mental states which are associated with the current mental state. We consider the hypothesis that such memory associations between past and present could be used for credit assignment through arbitrarily long sequences, propagating the credit assigned to the current state to the associated past state. Based on this principle, we study a novel algorithm which only back-propagates through a few of these temporal skip connections, realized by a learned attention mechanism that associates current states with relevant past states. We demonstrate in experiments that our method matches or outperforms regular BPTT and truncated BPTT in tasks involving particularly long-term dependencies, but without requiring the biologically implausible backward replay through the whole history of states. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method transfers to longer sequences significantly better than LSTMs trained with BPTT and LSTMs trained with full self-attention."
2018,Dendritic cortical microcircuits approximate the backpropagation algorithm.,"Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind these advances â€“ error backpropagation â€“ appears to be at odds with neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback. Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem."
2018,Learning Hierarchical Structures On-The-Fly with a Recurrent-Recursive Model for Sequences.,"Abstract
We propose a hierarchical model for sequential data that learns a tree on-the-fly, i.e. while reading the sequence. In the model, a recurrent network adapts its structure and reuses recurrent weights in a recursive manner. This creates adaptive skip-connections that ease the learning of long-term dependencies. The tree structure can either be inferred without supervision through reinforcement learning, or learned in a supervised manner. We provide preliminary experiments in a novel Math Expression Evaluation (MEE) task, which is created to have a hierarchical tree structure that can be used to study the effectiveness of our model. Additionally, we test our model in a well-known propositional logic and language modelling tasks. Experimental results have shown the potential of our approach."
2018,Speaker Recognition from Raw Waveform with SincNet.,"Abstract:
Deep learning is progressively gaining popularity as a viable alternative to i-vectors for speaker recognition. Promising results have been recently obtained with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when fed by raw speech samples directly. Rather than employing standard hand-crafted features, the latter CNNs learn low-level speech representations from waveforms, potentially allowing the network to better capture important narrow-band speaker characteristics such as pitch and formants. Proper design of the neural network is crucial to achieve this goal.This paper proposes a novel CNN architecture, called SincNet, that encourages the first convolutional layer to discover more meaningful filters. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which implement band-pass filters. In contrast to standard CNNs, that learn all elements of each filter, only low and high cutoff frequencies are directly learned from data with the proposed method. This offers a very compact and efficient way to derive a customized filter bank specifically tuned for the desired application.Our experiments, conducted on both speaker identification and speaker verification tasks, show that the proposed architecture converges faster and performs better than a standard CNN on raw waveforms."
2017,On integrating a language model into neural machine translation.,"Abstract
Recent advances in end-to-end neural machine translation models have achieved promising results on high-resource language pairs such as Enâ†’ Fr and Enâ†’ De. One of the major factor behind these successes is the availability of high quality parallel corpora. We explore two strategies on leveraging abundant amount of monolingual data for neural machine translation. We observe improvements by both combining scores from neural language model trained only on target monolingual data with neural machine translation model and fusing hidden-states of these two models. We obtain up to 2 BLEU improvement over hierarchical and phrase-based baseline on low-resource language pair, Turkishâ†’ English. Our method was initially motivated towards tasks with less parallel data, but we also show that it extends to high resource languages such as Csâ†’ En and Deâ†’ En translation tasks, where we obtain 0.39 and 0.47 BLEU improvements over the neural machine translation baselines, respectively."
2017,Context-dependent word representation for neural machine translation.,"Abstract
We first observe a potential weakness of continuous vector representations of symbols in neural machine translation. That is, the continuous vector representation, or a word embedding vector, of a symbol encodes multiple dimensions of similarity, equivalent to encoding more than one meaning of the word. This has the consequence that the encoder and decoder recurrent networks in neural machine translation need to spend substantial amount of their capacity in disambiguating source and target words based on the context which is defined by a source sentence. Based on this observation, in this paper we propose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear bag-of-words representation of the source sentence. Additionally, we propose to represent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with typed symbols to facilitate translating those words that are not well-suited to be translated via continuous vectors. The experiments on Enâ€“Fr and Enâ€“De reveal that the proposed approaches of contextualization and symbolization improves the translation quality of neural machine translation systems significantly."
2017,"Multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation.","
Abstract
We propose multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation. The proposed approach enables a single neural translation model to translate between multiple languages, with a number of parameters that grows only linearly with the number of languages. This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMTâ€™15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair. We empirically evaluate the proposed model on low-resource language translation tasks. In particular, we observe that the proposed multilingual model outperforms strong conventional statistical machine translation systems on Turkish-English and Uzbek-English by incorporating the resources of other language pairs."
2017,Equilibrium Propagation: Bridging the Gap between Energy-Based Models and Backpropagation.,"We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well-defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point or stationary distribution) toward a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged toward their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal “back-propagated” during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not. We also show experimentally that multi-layer recurrently connected networks with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST task.

2017,Quantized Neural Networks: Training Neural Networks with Low Precision Weights and Activations.,"We introduce a method to train Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) --- neural networks with extremely low precision (e.g., 1-bit) weights and activations, at run-time. At train-time the quantized weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, QNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations. As a result, power consumption is expected to be drastically reduced. We trained QNNs over the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets. The resulting QNNs achieve prediction accuracy comparable to their 32-bit counterparts. For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with 1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves 51% top-1 accuracy. Moreover, we quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients computation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks were tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as their 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The QNN code is available online."

Abstract
In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that weâ€™ve found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data.
We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most traditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is a convolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 fold speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on the 2013 BRATS test data-set reveal that our architecture improves over the currently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster.

2017,The representational geometry of word meanings acquired by neural machine translation models.,"This work is the first comprehensive analysis of the properties of word embeddings learned by neural machine translation (NMT) models trained on bilingual texts. We show the word representations of NMT models outperform those learned from monolingual text by established algorithms such as Skipgram and CBOW on tasks that require knowledge of semantic similarity and/or lexical–syntactic role. These effects hold when translating from English to French and English to German, and we argue that the desirable properties of NMT word embeddings should emerge largely independently of the source and target languages. Further, we apply a recently-proposed heuristic method for training NMT models with very large vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion method results in minimal degradation of embedding quality. This allows us to make a large vocabulary of NMT embeddings available for future research and applications. Overall, our analyses indicate that NMT embeddings should be used in applications that require word concepts to be organised according to similarity and/or lexical function, while monolingual embeddings are better suited to modelling (nonspecific) inter-word relatedness.

2017,STDP-Compatible Approximation of Backpropagation in an Energy-Based Model.,"We show that Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo inference in an energy-based model with latent variables has the property that the early steps of inference, starting from a stationary point, correspond to propagating error gradients into internal layers, similar to backpropagation. The backpropagated error is with respect to output units that have received an outside driving force pushing them away from the stationary point. Backpropagated error gradients correspond to temporal derivatives with respect to the activation of hidden units. These lead to a weight update proportional to the product of the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of the postsynaptic firing rate. Simulations and a theoretical argument suggest that this rate-based update rule is consistent with those associated with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The ideas presented in this article could be an element of a theory for explaining how brains perform credit assignment in deep hierarchies as efficiently as backpropagation does, with neural computation corresponding to both approximate inference in continuous-valued latent variables and error backpropagation, at the same time.

New benchmarks for both online and offline HCCR under a general framework.

Combination of convNet and domain-specific knowledge of directMap.

Abstract
Recent deep learning based methods have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) by learning discriminative representations directly from raw data. Nevertheless, we believe that the long-and-well investigated domain-specific knowledge should still help to boost the performance of HCCR. By integrating the traditional normalization-cooperated direction-decomposed feature map (directMap) with the deep convolutional neural network (convNet), we are able to obtain new highest accuracies for both online and offline HCCR on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. With this new framework, we can eliminate the needs for data augmentation and model ensemble, which are widely used in other systems to achieve their best results. This makes our framework to be efficient and effective for both training and testing. Furthermore, although directMap+convNet can achieve the best results and surpass human-level performance, we show that writer adaptation in this case is still effective. A new adaptation layer is proposed to reduce the mismatch between training and test data on a particular source layer. The adaptation process can be efficiently and effectively implemented in an unsupervised manner. By adding the adaptation layer into the pre-trained convNet, it can adapt to the new handwriting styles of particular writers, and the recognition accuracy can be further improved consistently and significantly. This paper gives an overview and comparison of recent deep learning based approaches for HCCR, and also sets new benchmarks for both online and offline HCCR."
2017,End-to-End Online Writer Identification With Recurrent Neural Network.,"Abstract:
Writer identification is an important topic for pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely heavily on sophisticated hand-crafted features to represent the characteristics of different writers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for online text-independent writer identification by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically, the handwriting data of a particular writer are represented by a set of random hybrid strokes (RHSs). Each RHS is a randomly sampled short sequence representing pen tip movements (
xy
-coordinates) and pen-down or pen-up states. RHS is independent of the content and language involved in handwriting; therefore, writer identification at the RHS level is more general and convenient than the character level or the word level, which also requires character/word segmentation. The RNN model with bidirectional long short-term memory is used to encode each RHS into a fixed-length vector for final classification. All the RHSs of a writer are classified independently, and then, the posterior probabilities are averaged to make the final decision. The proposed framework is end-to-end and does not require any domain knowledge for handwriting data analysis. Experiments on both English (133 writers) and Chinese (186 writers) databases verify the advantages of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."
2017,Denoising Criterion for Variational Auto-Encoding Framework.,"Denoising autoencoders (DAE) are trained to reconstruct their clean inputs with noise injected at the input level, while variational autoencoders (VAE) are trained with noise injected in their stochastic hidden layer, with a regularizer that encourages this noise injection. In this paper, we show that injecting noise both in input and in the stochastic hidden layer can be advantageous and we propose a modified variational lower bound as an improved objective function in this setup. When input is corrupted, then the standard VAE lower bound involves marginalizing the encoder conditional distribution over the input noise, which makes the training criterion intractable. Instead, we propose a modified training criterion which corresponds to a tractable bound when input is corrupted. Experimentally, we find that the proposed denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) yields better average log-likelihood than the VAE and the importance weighted autoencoder on the MNIST and Frey Face datasets."
2017,Multiresolution Recurrent Neural Networks: An Application to Dialogue Response Generation.,"We introduce a new class of models called multiresolution recurrent neural networks, which explicitly model natural language generation at multiple levels of abstraction. The models extend the sequence-to-sequence framework to generate two parallel stochastic processes: a sequence of high-level coarse tokens, and a sequence of natural language words (e.g. sentences). The coarse sequences follow a latent stochastic process with a factorial representation, which helps the models generalize to new examples. The coarse sequences can also incorporate task-specific knowledge, when available. In our experiments, the coarse sequences are extracted using automatic procedures, which are designed to capture compositional structure and semantics. These procedures enable training the multiresolution recurrent neural networks by maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. We apply the models to dialogue response generation in the technical support domain and compare them with several competing models. The multiresolution recurrent neural networks outperform competing models by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results according to both a human evaluation study and automatic evaluation metrics. Furthermore, experiments show the proposed models generate more fluent, relevant and goal-oriented responses."
2017,A Hierarchical Latent Variable Encoder-Decoder Model for Generating Dialogues.,"Sequential data often possesses hierarchical structures with complex dependencies between sub-sequences, such as found between the utterances in a dialogue. To model these dependencies in a generative framework, we propose a neural network-based generative architecture, with stochastic latent variables that span a variable number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the task of dialogue response generation and compare it with other recent neural-network architectures. We evaluate the model performance through a human evaluation study. The experiments demonstrate that our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent variables facilitate both the generation of meaningful, long and diverse responses and maintaining dialogue state."
2017,Towards an Automatic Turing Test: Learning to Evaluate Dialogue Responses.,"Abstract
Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem.We present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM modelâ€™s predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue mod-els unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation."
2017,The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation.,"Abstract:
State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets."
2017,Plug & Play Generative Networks: Conditional Iterative Generation of Images in Latent Space.,"Abstract:
Generating high-resolution, photo-realistic images has been a long-standing goal in machine learning. Recently, Nguyen et al. [37] showed one interesting way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient ascent in the latent space of a generator network to maximize the activations of one or multiple neurons in a separate classifier network. In this paper we extend this method by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227 Ã— 227) than previous generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition, we provide a unified probabilistic interpretation of related activation maximization methods and call the general class of models Plug and Play Generative Networks. PPGNs are composed of 1) a generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types and 2) a replaceable condition network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate the generation of images conditioned on a class (when C is an ImageNet or MIT Places classification network) and also conditioned on a caption (when C is an image captioning network). Our method also improves the state of the art of Multifaceted Feature Visualization [40], which generates the set of synthetic inputs that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task of image inpainting. While image models are used in this paper, the approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied to many types of data."
2017,On random weights for texture generation in one layer CNNS.,"Abstract:
Recent work in the literature has shown experimentally that one can use the lower layers of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to model natural textures. More interestingly, it has also been experimentally shown that only one layer with random filters can also model textures although with less variability. In this paper we ask the question as to why one layer CNNs with random filters are so effective in generating textures? We theoretically show that one layer convolutional architectures (without a non-linearity) paired with the an energy function used in previous literature, can in fact preserve and modulate frequency coefficients in a manner so that random weights and pretrained weights will generate the same type of images. Based on the results of this analysis we question whether similar properties hold in the case where one uses one convolution layer with a non-linearity. We show that in the case of ReLu non-linearity there are situations where only one input will give the minimum possible energy whereas in the case of no nonlinearity, there are always infinite solutions that will give the minimum possible energy. Thus we can show that in certain situations adding a ReLu non-linearity generates less variable images."
2017,A network of deep neural networks for Distant Speech Recognition.,"Abstract:
Despite the remarkable progress recently made in distant speech recognition, state-of-the-art technology still suffers from a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions characterized by non-stationary noises and reverberation are met. A prominent limitation of current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover, the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions, including recent joint training approaches."
2017,Count-ception: Counting by Fully Convolutional Redundant Counting.,"Abstract:
Counting objects in digital images is a process that should be replaced by machines. This tedious task is time consuming and prone to errors due to fatigue of human annotators. The goal is to have a system that takes as input an image and returns a count of the objects inside and justification for the prediction in the form of object localization. We repose a problem, originally posed by Lempitsky and Zisserman, to instead predict a count map which contains redundant counts based on the receptive field of a smaller regression network. The regression network predicts a count of the objects that exist inside this frame. By processing the image in a fully convolutional way each pixel is going to be accounted for some number of times, the number of windows which include it, which is the size of each window, (i.e., 32x32 = 1024). To recover the true count we take the average over the redundant predictions. Our contribution is redundant counting instead of predicting a density map in order to average over errors. We also propose a novel deep neural network architecture adapted from the Inception family of networks called the Count-ception network. Together our approach results in a 20% relative improvement (2.9 to 2.3 MAE) over the state of the art method by Xie, Noble, and Zisserman in 2016."
2017,Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes.,"Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes.
We propose a new method to better understand the roles and dynamics
of the intermediate layers.

Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as ""probes"",
where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer
as discriminating features.
Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model,
and they are generally added after training.

We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better intuition
about models and to diagnose potential problems."
2017,An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction.,"We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling. "
2017,Mode Regularized Generative Adversarial Networks.,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a
variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss
modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular
functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which
can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction,
towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.
We introduce several ways of regularizing the objective, which can dramatically
stabilize the training of GAN models. We also show that our regularizers can help
the fair distribution of probability mass across the modes of the data generating
distribution during the early phases of training, thus providing a unified solution
to the missing modes problem."
2017,Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks.,"Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long- standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. We show some evidence that the proposed model can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences without using explicit boundary information. We evaluate our proposed model on character-level language modelling and handwriting sequence generation."
2017,Mollifying Networks.,"The optimization of deep neural networks can be more challenging than the traditional convex optimization problems due to highly non-convex nature of the loss function, e.g. it can involve pathological landscapes such as saddle-surfaces that can be difficult to escape from for algorithms based on simple gradient descent. In this paper, we attack the problem of optimization of highly non-convex neural networks objectives by starting with a smoothed -- or mollified -- objective function which becomes more complex as the training proceeds.  Our proposition is inspired by the recent studies in continuation methods: similarly to curriculum methods, we begin by learning an easier (possibly convex) objective function and let it evolve during training until it eventually becomes the original, difficult to optimize objective function. The complexity of the mollified networks is controlled by a single hyperparameter that is annealed during training. We show improvements on various difficult optimization tasks and establish a relationship between recent works on continuation methods for neural networks and mollifiers."
2017,Zoneout: Regularizing RNNs by Randomly Preserving Hidden Activations.,"We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs.
At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values.
Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization.
But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks.
We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks. We achieve competitive results with relatively simple models in character- and word-level language modelling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and combining with recurrent batch normalization yields state-of-the-art results on permuted sequential MNIST."
2017,A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding.,"This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification and textual entailment. Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks."
2017,Towards an automatic Turing test: Learning to evaluate dialogue responses.,"Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem.

2017,SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model.,"In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time. We show that our model which profits from combining memory-less modules, namely autoregressive multilayer perceptron, and stateful recurrent neural networks in a hierarchical structure is de facto powerful to capture the underlying sources of variations in temporal domain for very long time on three datasets of different nature. Human evaluation on the generated samples indicate that our model is preferred over competing models. We also show how each component of the model contributes to the exhibited performance."
2017,Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning.,"Humans learn a predictive model of the world and use this model to reason about future events and the consequences of actions. In contrast to most machine predictors, we exhibit an impressive ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and reason intelligently in these settings.  One important aspect of this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution.  Our task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks. We demonstrate that an unsupervised model, trained to predict future frames of a video sequence of stable and unstable block configurations, can yield features that support extrapolating stability prediction to blocks configurations outside the training set distribution"
2017,Diet Networks: Thin Parameters for Fat Genomics.,"Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier."
2017,Char2Wav: End-to-End Speech Synthesis.,"We present Char2Wav, an end-to-end model for speech synthesis. Char2Wav has two components: a reader and a neural vocoder. The reader is an encoder-decoder model with attention. The encoder is a bidirectional recurrent neural network that accepts text or phonemes as inputs, while the decoder is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention that produces vocoder acoustic features. Neural vocoder refers to a conditional extension of SampleRNN which generates raw waveform samples from intermediate representations. Unlike traditional models for speech synthesis, Char2Wav learns to produce audio directly from text."
2017,Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching.,"We propose an augmented training procedure for generative adversarial networks designed to address shortcomings of the original by directing the generator towards probable configurations of abstract discriminator features. We estimate and track the distribution of these features, as computed from data, with a denoising auto-encoder, and use it to propose high-level targets for the generator. We combine this new loss with the original and evaluate the hybrid criterion on the task of unsupervised image synthesis from datasets comprising a diverse set of visual categories, noting a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the ``objectness'' of the resulting samples."
2017,A Closer Look at Memorization in Deep Networks.,"We examine the role of memorization in deep learning, drawing connections to capacity, generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks are capable of memorizing noise data, our results suggest that they tend to prioritize learning simple patterns first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative differences in gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) on noise vs.~real data. We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g.,~dropout) we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained with gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role in determining the degree of memorization."
2017,Sharp Minima Can Generalize For Deep Nets.,"Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g.\ Hochreiter \& Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al.\ (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Or, depending on the definition of flatness, it is the same for any given minimum. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties."
2017,A robust adaptive stochastic gradient method for deep learning.,"Abstract:
Stochastic gradient algorithms are the main focus of large-scale optimization problems and led to important successes in the recent advancement of the deep learning algorithms. The convergence of SGD depends on the careful choice of learning rate and the amount of the noise in stochastic estimates of the gradients. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate algorithm, which utilizes stochastic curvature information of the loss function for automatically tuning the learning rates. The information about the element-wise curvature of the loss function is estimated from the local statistics of the stochastic first order gradients. We further propose a new variance reduction technique to speed up the convergence. In our experiments with deep neural networks, we obtained better performance compared to the popular stochastic gradient algorithms."
2017,Improving Speech Recognition by Revising Gated Recurrent Units.,"Speech recognition is largely taking advantage of deep learning, showing that substantial benefits can be obtained by modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The most popular RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), which typically reach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks thanks to their ability to learn long-term dependencies and robustness to vanishing gradients. Nevertheless, LSTMs have a rather complex design with three multiplicative gates, that might impair their efficient implementation. An attempt to simplify LSTMs has recently led to Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are based on just two multiplicative gates.

This paper builds on these efforts by further revising GRUs and proposing a simplified architecture potentially more suitable for speech recognition. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we suggest to remove the reset gate in the GRU design, resulting in a more efficient single-gate architecture. Second, we propose to replace tanh with ReLU activations in the state update equations. Results show that, in our implementation, the revised architecture reduces the per-epoch training time with more than 30% and consistently improves recognition performance across different tasks, input features, and noisy conditions when compared to a standard GRU."
2017,Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition.,"Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the activities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and stability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique called Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling in speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting parameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the acoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel noises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed approach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information such as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically generates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep bidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets for large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The experimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms of transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and environments.

2017,Variational Walkback: Learning a Transition Operator as a Stochastic Recurrent Net.,"We propose a novel method to {\it directly} learn a stochastic transition operator whose repeated application provides generated samples. Traditional undirected graphical models approach this problem indirectly by learning a Markov chain model whose stationary distribution obeys detailed balance with respect to a parameterized energy function. The energy function is then modified so the model and data distributions match, with no guarantee on the number of steps required for the Markov chain to converge. Moreover, the detailed balance condition is highly restrictive: energy based models corresponding to neural networks must have symmetric weights, unlike biological neural circuits. In contrast, we develop a method for directly learning arbitrarily parameterized transition operators capable of expressing non-equilibrium stationary distributions that violate detailed balance, thereby enabling us to learn more biologically plausible asymmetric neural networks and more general non-energy based dynamical systems. The proposed training objective, which we derive via principled variational methods, encourages the transition operator to ""walk back"" (prefer to revert its steps) in multi-step trajectories that start at data-points, as quickly as possible back to the original data points. We present a series of experimental results illustrating the soundness of the proposed approach, Variational Walkback (VW), on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and CelebA datasets, demonstrating superior samples compared to earlier attempts to learn a transition operator. We also show that although each rapid training trajectory is limited to a finite but variable number of steps, our transition operator continues to generate good samples well past the length of such trajectories, thereby demonstrating the match of its non-equilibrium stationary distribution to the data distribution.

2017,GibbsNet: Iterative Adversarial Inference for Deep Graphical Models.,"Directed latent variable models that formulate the joint distribution as p(x,z) = p(z) p(x \mid z)
have the advantage of fast and exact sampling. However, these models have the weakness of needing to specify p(z)
, often with a simple fixed prior that limits the expressiveness of the model. Undirected latent variable models discard the requirement that p(z)
be specified with a prior, yet sampling from them generally requires an iterative procedure such as blocked Gibbs-sampling that may require many steps to draw samples from the joint distribution p(x, z)
. We propose a novel approach to learning the joint distribution between the data and a latent code which uses an adversarially learned iterative procedure to gradually refine the joint distribution, p(x, z)
, to better match with the data distribution on each step. GibbsNet is the best of both worlds both in theory and in practice. Achieving the speed and simplicity of a directed latent variable model, it is guaranteed (assuming the adversarial game reaches the virtual training criteria global minimum) to produce samples from p(x, z)
with only a few sampling iterations. Achieving the expressiveness and flexibility of an undirected latent variable model, GibbsNet does away with the need for an explicit p(z)
and has the ability to do attribute prediction, class-conditional generation, and joint image-attribute modeling in a single model which is not trained for any of these specific tasks. We show empirically that GibbsNet is able to learn a more complex p(z)
and show that this leads to improved inpainting and iterative refinement of p(x, z)
for dozens of steps and stable generation without collapse for thousands of steps, despite being trained on only a few steps."
2017,"Plan, Attend, Generate: Planning for Sequence-to-Sequence Models.","We investigate the integration of a planning mechanism into sequence-to-sequence models using attention. We develop a model which can plan ahead in the future when it computes its alignments between input and output sequences, constructing a matrix of proposed future alignments and a commitment vector that governs whether to follow or recompute the plan. This mechanism is inspired by the recently proposed strategic attentive reader and writer (STRAW) model for Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable using primarily differentiable operations. We show that it outperforms a strong baseline on character-level translation tasks from WMT'15, the algorithmic task of finding Eulerian circuits of graphs, and question generation from the text. Our analysis demonstrates that the model computes qualitatively intuitive alignments, converges faster than the baselines, and achieves superior performance with fewer parameters."
2017,Z-Forcing: Training Stochastic Recurrent Networks.,"Many efforts have been devoted to training generative latent variable models with autoregressive decoders, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). Stochastic recurrent models have been successful in capturing the variability observed in natural sequential data such as speech. We unify successful ideas from recently proposed architectures into a stochastic recurrent model: each step in the sequence is associated with a latent variable that is used to condition the recurrent dynamics for future steps. Training is performed with amortised variational inference where the approximate posterior is augmented with a RNN that runs backward through the sequence. In addition to maximizing the variational lower bound, we ease training of the latent variables by adding an auxiliary cost which forces them to reconstruct the state of the backward recurrent network. This provides the latent variables with a task-independent objective that enhances the performance of the overall model. We found this strategy to perform better than alternative approaches such as KL annealing. Although being conceptually simple, our model achieves state-of-the-art results on standard speech benchmarks such as TIMIT and Blizzard and competitive performance on sequential MNIST. Finally, we apply our model to language modeling on the IMDB dataset where the auxiliary cost helps in learning interpretable latent variables."
2017,"Plan, Attend, Generate: Character-Level Neural Machine Translation with Planning.","Abstract
We investigate the integration of a planning mechanism into an encoder-decoder architecture with attention. We develop a model that can plan ahead when it computes alignments between the source and target sequences not only for a single time-step but for the next k time-steps as well by constructing a matrix of proposed future alignments and a commitment vector that governs whether to follow or recompute the plan. This mechanism is inspired by strategic attentive reader and writer (STRAW) model, a recent neural architecture for planning with hierarchical reinforcement learning that can also learn higher level temporal abstractions. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable with differentiable operations. We show that our model outperforms strong baselines on character-level translation task from WMTâ€™15 with fewer parameters and computes alignments that are qualitatively intuitive."
2016,Knowledge Matters: Importance of Prior Information for Optimization.,"We explored the effect of introducing prior knowledge into the intermediate level of deep supervised neural networks on two tasks. On a task we designed, all black-box state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms which we tested, failed to generalize well. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that, there is a training barrier involved in the nature of such tasks, and that humans learn useful intermediate concepts from other individuals by using a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. Our results provide a positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, we trained a two- tiered MLP architecture on a dataset for which each input image contains three sprites, and the binary target class is 1 if all of three shapes belong to the same category and otherwise the class is 0. In terms of generalization, black-box machine learning algorithms could not perform better than chance on this task. Standard deep supervised neural networks also failed to generalize. However, using a particular structure and guiding the learner by providing intermediate targets in the form of intermediate concepts (the presence of each object) allowed us to solve the task efficiently. We obtained much better than chance, but imperfect results by exploring different architectures and optimization variants. This observation might be an indication of optimization difficulty when the neural network trained without hints on this task. We hypothesize that the learning difficulty is due to the composition of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with the hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of training of neural networks sometimes getting stuck, even though good solutions exist, both in terms of training and generalization error."
2016,EmoNets: Multimodal deep learning approaches for emotion recognition in video.,"Abstract
The task of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) Challenge is to assign one of seven emotions to short video clips extracted from Hollywood style movies. The videos depict acted-out emotions under realistic conditions with a large degree of variation in attributes such as pose and illumination, making it worthwhile to explore approaches which consider combinations of features from multiple modalities for label assignment. In this paper we present our approach to learning several specialist models using deep learning techniques, each focusing on one modality. Among these are a convolutional neural network, focusing on capturing visual information in detected faces, a deep belief net focusing on the representation of the audio stream, a K-Means based â€œbag-of-mouthsâ€ model, which extracts visual features around the mouth region and a relational autoencoder, which addresses spatio-temporal aspects of videos. We explore multiple methods for the combination of cues from these modalities into one common classifier. This achieves a considerably greater accuracy than predictions from our strongest single-modality classifier. Our method was the winning submission in the 2013 EmotiW challenge and achieved a test set accuracy of 47.67 % on the 2014 dataset."
2016,Big Data: Theoretical Aspects [Scanning the Issue].,"Abstract:
This special issue highlights a number of algorithmic approaches that are fundamental to data analysis, both in formulating and solving problems that relate to Big Data."
2016,Learning to Understand Phrases by Embedding the Dictionary.,"Distributional models that learn rich semantic word representations are a success story of recent NLP research. However, developing models that learn useful representations of phrases and sentences has proved far harder. We propose using the definitions found in everyday dictionaries as a means of bridging this gap between lexical and phrasal semantics. Neural language embedding models can be effectively trained to map dictionary definitions (phrases) to (lexical) representations of the words defined by those definitions. We present two applications of these architectures: 'reverse dictionaries' that return the name of a concept given a definition or description and general-knowledge crossword question answerers. On both tasks, neural language embedding models trained on definitions from a handful of freely-available lexical resources perform as well or better than existing commercial systems that rely on significant task-specific engineering. The results highlight the effectiveness of both neural embedding architectures and definition-based training for developing models that understand phrases and sentences.

2016,Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models.,"We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings."
2016,A Character-level Decoder without Explicit Segmentation for Neural Machine Translation.,"The existing machine translation systems, whether phrase-based or neural, have relied almost exclusively on word-level modelling with explicit segmentation. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can neural machine translation generate a character sequence without any explicit segmentation? To answer this question, we evaluate an attention-based encoder-decoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder on four language pairs--En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fi-- using the parallel corpora from WMT'15. Our experiments show that the models with a character-level decoder outperform the ones with a subword-level decoder on all of the four language pairs. Furthermore, the ensembles of neural models with a character-level decoder outperform the state-of-the-art non-neural machine translation systems on En-Cs, En-De and En-Fi and perform comparably on En-Ru."
2016,Pointing the Unknown Words.,"The problem of rare and unknown words is an important issue that can potentially influence the performance of many NLP systems, including both the traditional count-based and the deep learning models. We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. Our model uses two softmax layers in order to predict the next word in conditional language models: one predicts the location of a word in the source sentence, and the other predicts a word in the shortlist vocabulary. At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model."
2016,Generating Factoid Questions With Recurrent Neural Networks: The 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus.,"Over the past decade, large-scale supervised learning corpora have enabled machine learning researchers to make substantial advances. However, to this date, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. In this paper we present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the knowledge base Freebase to transduce facts into natural language questions. The produced question answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using automatic evaluation metrics, including well-established machine translation and sentence similarity metrics. Across all evaluation criteria the question-generation model outperforms the competing template-based baseline. Furthermore, when presented to human evaluators, the generated questions appear comparable in quality to real human-generated questions."
2016,Oracle Performance for Visual Captioning.,"The task of associating images and videos with a natural language description has attracted a great amount of attention recently. The state-of-the-art results on some of the standard datasets have been pushed into the regime where it has become more and more difficult to make significant improvements. Instead of proposing new models, this work investigates performances that an oracle can obtain. In order to disentangle the contribution from visual model from the language model, our oracle assumes that high-quality visual concept extractor is available and focuses only on the language part. We demonstrate the construction of such oracles on MS-COCO, YouTube2Text and LSMDC (a combination of M-VAD and MPII-MD). Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the model and the training procedure, we show that current state-of-the-art models fall short when being compared with the learned oracle. Furthermore, it suggests the inability of current models in capturing important visual concepts in captioning tasks."
2016,ReSeg: A Recurrent Neural Network-Based Model for Semantic Segmentation.,"Abstract:
We propose a structured prediction architecture, which exploits the local generic features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks and the capacity of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to retrieve distant dependencies. The proposed architecture, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for image classification. We modify and extend it to perform the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. Each ReNet layer is composed of four RNN that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, encoding patches or activations, and providing relevant global information. Moreover, ReNet layers are stacked on top of pre-trained convolutional layers, benefiting from generic local features. Upsampling layers follow ReNet layers to recover the original image resolution in the final predictions. The proposed ReSeg architecture is efficient, flexible and suitable for a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on several widely-used semantic segmentation datasets: Weizmann Horse, Oxford Flower, and CamVid, achieving stateof-the-art performance. Results show that ReSeg can act as a suitable architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, and may have further applications in other structured prediction problems. The source code and model hyperparameters are available on https://github.com/fvisin/reseg."
2016,Batch normalized recurrent neural networks.,"Abstract:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful models for sequential data that have the potential to learn long-term dependencies. However, they are computationally expensive to train and difficult to parallelize. Recent work has shown that normalizing intermediate representations of neural networks can significantly improve convergence rates in feed-forward neural networks [1]. In particular, batch normalization, which uses mini-batch statistics to standardize features, was shown to significantly reduce training time. In this paper, we investigate how batch normalization can be applied to RNNs. We show for both a speech recognition task and language modeling that the way we apply batch normalization leads to a faster convergence of the training criterion but doesn't seem to improve the generalization performance."
2016,End-to-end attention-based large vocabulary speech recognition.,"Abstract:
Many state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) Systems are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus."
2016,Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks.,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are notoriously difficult to train. When the eigenvalues of the hidden to hidden weight matrix deviate from absolute value 1, optimization becomes difficult due to the well studied issue of vanishing and exploding gradients, especially when trying to learn long-term dependencies. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new architecture that learns a unitary weight matrix, with eigenvalues of absolute value exactly 1. The challenge we address is that of parametrizing unitary matrices in a way that does not require expensive computations (such as eigendecomposition) after each weight update. We construct an expressive unitary weight matrix by composing several structured matrices that act as building blocks with parameters to be learned. Optimization with this parameterization becomes feasible only when considering hidden states in the complex domain. We demonstrate the potential of this architecture by achieving state of the art results in several hard tasks involving very long-term dependencies."
2016,Deconstructing the Ladder Network Architecture.,"The Ladder Network is a recent new approach to semi-supervised learning that turned out to be very successful. While showing impressive performance, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose contributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. This paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants of the Ladder Network in which we replaced or removed individual components to learn about their relative importance. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most important contribution is made by the lateral connections, followed by the application of noise, and the choice of what we refer to as the â€˜combinator functionâ€™. As the number of labeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and the reconstruction criterion become less important, with most of the generalization improvement coming from the injection of noise in each layer. Finally, we introduce a combinator function that reduces test error rates on Permutation-Invariant MNIST to 0.57% for the supervised setting, and to 0.97% and 1.0% for semi-supervised settings with 1000 and 100 labeled examples, respectively."
2016,Bidirectional Helmholtz Machines.,"Efficient unsupervised training and inference in deep generative models remains a challenging problem. One basic approach, called Helmholtz machine or Variational Autoencoder, involves training a top-down directed generative model together with a bottom-up auxiliary model used for approximate inference. Recent results indicate that better generative models can be obtained with better approximate inference procedures. Instead of improving the inference procedure, we here propose a new model, the bidirectional Helmholtz machine, which guarantees that the top-down and bottom-up distributions can efficiently invert each other. We achieve this by interpreting both the top-down and the bottom-up directed models as approximate inference distributions and by defining the model distribution to be the geometric mean of these two. We present a lower-bound for the likelihood of this model and we show that optimizing this bound regularizes the model so that the Bhattacharyya distance between the bottom-up and top-down approximate distributions is minimized. This approach results in state of the art generative models which prefer significantly deeper architectures while it allows for orders of magnitude more efficient likelihood estimation."
2016,Noisy Activation Functions.,"Common nonlinear activation functions used in neural networks can cause training difficulties due to the saturation behavior of the activation function, which may hide dependencies that are not visible to vanilla-SGD (using first order gradients only). Gating mechanisms that use softly saturating activation functions to emulate the discrete switching of digital logic circuits are good examples of this. We propose to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that the gradients may flow easily, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would yield zero gradients. Large noise will dominate the noise-free gradient and allow stochastic gradient descent to explore more. By adding noise only to the problematic parts of the activation function, we allow the optimization procedure to explore the boundary between the degenerate saturating) and the well-behaved parts of the activation function. We also establish connections to simulated annealing, when the amount of noise is annealed down, making it easier to optimize hard objective functions. We find experimentally that replacing such saturating activation functions by noisy variants helps optimization in many contexts, yielding state-of-the-art or competitive results on different datasets and task, especially when training seems to be the most difficult, e.g., when curriculum learning is necessary to obtain good results."
2016,Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an ‘end-to-end’ speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.

2016,HeMIS: Hetero-Modal Image Segmentation.,"Abstract
We introduce a deep learning image segmentation framework that is extremely robust to missing imaging modalities. Instead of attempting to impute or synthesize missing data, the proposed approach learns, for each modality, an embedding of the input image into a single latent vector space for which arithmetic operations (such as taking the mean) are well defined. Points in that space, which are averaged over modalities available at inference time, can then be further processed to yield the desired segmentation. As such, any combinatorial subset of available modalities can be provided as input, without having to learn a combinatorial number of imputation models. Evaluated on two neurological MRI datasets (brain tumors and MS lesions), the approach yields state-of-the-art segmentation results when provided with all modalities; moreover, its performance degrades remarkably gracefully when modalities are removed, significantly more so than alternative mean-filling or other synthesis approaches."
2016,"Multi-Way, Multilingual Neural Machine Translation with a Shared Attention Mechanism.","We propose multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation. The proposed approach enables a single neural translation model to translate between multiple languages, with a number of parameters that grows only linearly with the number of languages. This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMT'15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair. In particular, we observe that the proposed model significantly improves the translation quality of low-resource language pairs."
2016,Architectural Complexity Measures of Recurrent Neural Networks.,"In this paper, we systematically analyze the connecting architectures of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Our main contribution is twofold: first, we present a rigorous graph-theoretic framework describing the connecting architectures of RNNs in general. Second, we propose three architecture complexity measures of RNNs: (a) the recurrent depth, which captures the RNNâ€™s over-time nonlinear complexity, (b) the feedforward depth, which captures the local input-output nonlinearity (similar to the â€œdepthâ€ in feedforward neural networks (FNNs)), and (c) the recurrent skip coefficient which captures how rapidly the information propagates over time. We rigorously prove each measureâ€™s existence and computability. Our experimental results show that RNNs might benefit from larger recurrent depth and feedforward depth. We further demonstrate that increasing recurrent skip coefficient offers performance boosts on long term dependency problems."
2016,On Multiplicative Integration with Recurrent Neural Networks.,"We introduce a general simple structural design called â€œMultiplicative Integrationâ€ (MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the way of how the information flow gets integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models."
2016,Binarized Neural Networks.,"We introduce a method to train Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) - neural networks with binary weights and activations at run-time. At train-time the binary weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, BNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations, which is expected to substantially improve power-efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of BNNs, we conducted two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks. On both, BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. We also report our preliminary results on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Last but not least, we wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The code for training and running our BNNs is available on-line."
2016,Professor Forcing: A New Algorithm for Training Recurrent Networks.,"The Teacher Forcing algorithm trains recurrent networks by supplying observed sequence values as inputs during training and using the networkâ€™s own one-step-ahead predictions to do multi-step sampling. We introduce the Professor Forcing algorithm, which uses adversarial domain adaptation to encourage the dynamics of the recurrent network to be the same when training the network and when sampling from the network over multiple time steps. We apply Professor Forcing to language modeling, vocal synthesis on raw waveforms, handwriting generation, and image generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer, improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST. We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples, especially when sampling for a large number of time steps. This is supported by human evaluation of sample quality. Trade-offs between Professor Forcing and Scheduled Sampling are discussed. We produce T-SNEs showing that Professor Forcing successfully makes the dynamics of the network during training and sampling more similar."
2016,Batch-normalized joint training for DNN-based distant speech recognition.,"Abstract:
Improving distant speech recognition is a crucial step towards flexible human-machine interfaces. Current technology, however, still exhibits a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions are met. Despite the significant progress made in the last years on both speech enhancement and speech recognition, one potential limitation of state-of-the-art technology lies in composing modules that are not well matched because they are not trained jointly."
2016,NYU-MILA Neural Machine Translation Systems for WMT'16.,"We describe the neural machine translation system of New York University (NYU) and University of Montreal (MILA) for the translation tasks of WMT’16. The main goal of NYU-MILA submission to WMT’16 is to evaluate a new character-level decoding approach in neural machine translation on various language pairs. The proposed neural machine translation system is an attention-based encoder?decoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder. The decoder of the neural machine translation system does not require explicit segmentation, when characters are used as tokens. The character-level decoding approach provides benefits especially when translating a source language into other morphologically rich languages."
2016,Neural Networks with Few Multiplications.,"For most deep learning algorithms training is notoriously time consuming. Since most of the computation in training neural networks is typically spent on floating point multiplications, we investigate an approach to training that eliminates the need for most of these. Our method consists of two parts: First we stochastically binarize weights to convert multiplications involved in computing hidden states to sign changes. Second, while back-propagating error derivatives, in addition to binarizing the weights, we quantize the representations at each layer to convert the remaining multiplications into binary shifts. Experimental results across 3 popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN) show that this approach not only does not hurt classification performance but can result in even better performance than standard stochastic gradient descent training, paving the way to fast, hardware-friendly training of neural networks."
2015,Deep learning.,"Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.

The ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning1 focused on three challenges: the black box learning challenge, the facial expression recognition challenge, and the multimodal learning challenge.

2015,Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Slot Filling in Spoken Language Understanding.,"Abstract:
Semantic slot filling is one of the most challenging problems in spoken language understanding (SLU). In this paper, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task, and present several novel architectures designed to efficiently model past and future temporal dependencies. Specifically, we implemented and compared several important RNN architectures, including Elman, Jordan, and hybrid variants. To facilitate reproducibility, we implemented these networks with the publicly available Theano neural network toolkit and completed experiments on the well-known airline travel information system (ATIS) benchmark. In addition, we compared the approaches on two custom SLU data sets from the entertainment and movies domains. Our results show that the RNN-based models outperform the conditional random field (CRF) baseline by 2% in absolute error reduction on the ATIS benchmark. We improve the state-of-the-art by 0.5% in the Entertainment domain, and 6.7% for the movies domain."
2015,Describing Multimedia Content Using Attention-Based Encoder-Decoder Networks.,"Abstract:
Whereas deep neural networks were first mostly used for classification tasks, they are rapidly expanding in the realm of structured output problems, where the observed target is composed of multiple random variables that have a rich joint distribution, given the input. In this paper we focus on the case where the input also has a rich structure and the input and output structures are somehow related. We describe systems that learn to attend to different places in the input, for each element of the output, for a variety of tasks: machine translation, image caption generation, video clip description, and speech recognition. All these systems are based on a shared set of building blocks: gated recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, along with trained attention mechanisms. We report on experimental results with these systems, showing impressively good performance and the advantage of the attention mechanism."
2015,On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary for Neural Machine Translation.,"Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results compared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation. Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we use the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we achieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the English!German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art English!French translation system."
2015,IAPR keynote lecture IV: Deep learning.,"Abstract:
Deep learning has arisen around 2006 as a renewal of neural networks research allowing such models to have more layers. Theoretical investigations have shown that functions obtained as deep compositions of simpler functions (which includes both deep and recurrent nets) can express highly varying functions (with many ups and downs and different input regions that can be distinguished) much more efficiently (with fewer parameters) than otherwise. Empirical work in a variety of applications has demonstrated that, when well trained, such deep architectures can be highly successful, remarkably breaking through previous state-of-the-art in many areas, including speech recognition, object recognition, language models, and transfer learning. This talk will summarize the advances that have made these breakthroughs possible, and end with questions about some major challenges still ahead of researchers in order to continue our climb towards AI-level competence."
2015,A Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder for Generative Context-Aware Query Suggestion.,"ABSTRACT
Users may strive to formulate an adequate textual query for their information need. Search engines assist the users by presenting query suggestions. To preserve the original search intent, suggestions should be context-aware and account for the previous queries issued by the user. Achieving context awareness is challenging due to data sparsity. We present a novel hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that makes possible to account for sequences of previous queries of arbitrary lengths. As a result, our suggestions are sensitive to the order of queries in the context while avoiding data sparsity. Additionally, our model can suggest for rare, or long-tail, queries. The produced suggestions are synthetic and are sampled one word at a time, using computationally cheap decoding techniques. This is in contrast to current synthetic suggestion models relying upon machine learning pipelines and hand-engineered feature sets. Results show that our model outperforms existing context-aware approaches in a next query prediction setting. In addition to query suggestion, our architecture is general enough to be used in a variety of other applications."
2015,BilBOWA: Fast Bilingual Distributed Representations without Word Alignments.,"We introduce BilBOWA (Bilingual Bag-of-Words without Alignments), a simple and computationally-efficient model for learning bilingual distributed representations of words which can scale to large monolingual datasets and does not require word-aligned parallel training data. Instead it trains directly on monolingual data and extracts a bilingual signal from a smaller set of raw-text sentence-aligned data. This is achieved using a novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective, which is used to regularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient cross-lingual feature learning. We show that bilingual embeddings learned using the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a cross-lingual document classification task as well as a lexical translation task on the WMT11 data."
2015,"Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention.","Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO."
2015,Gated Feedback Recurrent Neural Networks.,"In this work, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The proposed RNN, gated-feedback RNN (GF-RNN), extends the existing approach of stacking multiple recurrent layers by allowing and controlling signals flowing from upper recurrent layers to lower layers using a global gating unit for each pair of layers. The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GF-RNN can adaptively assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by learning to gate these interactions."
2015,Attention-Based Models for Speech Recognition.,"Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks including machine translation, handwriting synthesis and image caption generation. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation reaches a competitive 18.6\% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18\% PER in single utterances and 20\% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6\% level."
2015,Equilibrated adaptive learning rates for non-convex optimization.,"Parameter-specific adaptive learning rate methods are computationally efficient ways to reduce the ill-conditioning problems encountered when training large deep networks. Following recent work that strongly suggests that most of thecritical points encountered when training such networks are saddle points, we find how considering the presence of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian could help us design better suited adaptive learning rate schemes. We show that the popular Jacobi preconditioner has undesirable behavior in the presence of both positive and negative curvature, and present theoretical and empirical evidence that the so-called equilibration preconditioner is comparatively better suited to non-convex problems. We introduce a novel adaptive learning rate scheme, called ESGD, based on the equilibration preconditioner. Our experiments demonstrate that both schemes yield very similar step directions but that ESGD sometimes surpasses RMSProp in terms of convergence speed, always clearly improving over plain stochastic gradient descent."
2015,A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data.,"In this paper, we explore the inclusion of latent random variables into the hidden state of a recurrent neural network (RNN) by combining the elements of the variational autoencoder. We argue that through the use of high-level latent random variables, the variational RNN (VRNN) can model the kind of variability observed in highly structured sequential data such as natural speech. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against other related sequential models on four speech datasets and one handwriting dataset. Our results show the important roles that latent random variables can play in the RNN dynamics."
2015,BinaryConnect: Training Deep Neural Networks with binary weights during propagations.,"Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN."
2015,Artificial Neural Networks Applied to Taxi Destination Prediction.,"We describe our first-place solution to the ECML/PKDD discovery challenge on taxi destination prediction. The task consisted in predicting the destination of a taxi based on the beginning of its trajectory, represented as a variable-length sequence of GPS points, and diverse associated meta-information, such as the departure time, the driver id and client information. Contrary to most published competitor approaches, we used an almost fully automated approach based on neural networks and we ranked first out of 381 teams. The architectures we tried use multi-layer perceptrons, bidirectional recurrent neural networks and models inspired from recently introduced memory networks. Our approach could easily be adapted to other applications in which the goal is to predict a fixed-length output from a variable-length sequence."
2015,Difference Target Propagation.,"Abstract
Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks."
2015,Montreal Neural Machine Translation Systems for WMT'15.,"Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have recently achieved results comparable to the state of the art on a few translation tasks, including English?French and English?German. The main purpose of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) submission to WMT’15 is to evaluate this new approach on a greater variety of language pairs. Furthermore, the human evaluation campaign may help us and the research community to better understand the behaviour of our systems. We use the RNNsearch architecture, which adds an attention mechanism to the encoderdecoder. We also leverage some of the recent developments in NMT, including the use of large vocabularies, unknown word replacement and, to a limited degree, the inclusion of monolingual language models."
2015,Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.,"Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."
2015,Reweighted Wake-Sleep.,"Training deep directed graphical models with many hidden variables and performing inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this reweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that a sigmoidal belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative models."
2015,Low precision arithmetic for deep learning.,"Multipliers are the most space and power-hungry arithmetic operators of the digital implementation of deep neural networks. We train a set of state-of-the-art neural networks (Maxout networks) on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. They are trained with three distinct formats: floating point, fixed point and dynamic fixed point. For each of those datasets and for each of those formats, we assess the impact of the precision of the multiplications on the final error after training. We find that very low precision is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them. For example, it is possible to train Maxout networks with 10 bits multiplications."
2015,NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation.,"We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting."
2015,Embedding Word Similarity with Neural Machine Translation.,"Neural language models learn word representations, or embeddings, that capture rich linguistic and conceptual information. Here we investigate the embeddings learned by neural machine translation models, a recently-developed class of neural language model. We show that embeddings from translation models outperform those learned by monolingual models at tasks that require knowledge of both conceptual similarity and lexical-syntactic role. We further show that these effects hold when translating from both English to French and English to German, and argue that the desirable properties of translation embeddings should emerge largely independently of the source and target languages. Finally, we apply a new method for training neural translation models with very large vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion algorithm results in minimal degradation of embedding quality. Our embedding spaces can be queried in an online demo and downloaded from our web page. Overall, our analyses indicate that translation-based embeddings should be used in applications that require concepts to be organised according to similarity and/or lexical function, while monolingual embeddings are better suited to modelling (nonspecific) inter-word relatedness."
2015,Target Propagation.,"Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of nonlinearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete.

2015,Ensemble of Generative and Discriminative Techniques for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews.,"Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that aims to detect polarity of a text document (typically a consumer review). In the simplest settings, we discriminate only between positive and negative sentiment, turning the task into a standard binary classification problem. We compare several ma- chine learning approaches to this problem, and combine them to achieve the best possible results. We show how to use for this task the standard generative lan- guage models, which are slightly complementary to the state of the art techniques. We achieve strong results on a well-known dataset of IMDB movie reviews. Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish also the code needed to repeat the experiments. This should simplify further advance of the state of the art, as other researchers can combine their techniques with ours with little effort."
2015,FitNets: Hints for Thin Deep Nets.,"While depth tends to improve network performances, it also makes gradient-based training more difficult since deeper networks tend to be more non-linear. The recently proposed knowledge distillation approach is aimed at obtaining small and fast-to-execute models, and it has shown that a student network could imitate the soft output of a larger teacher network or ensemble of networks. In this paper, we extend this idea to allow the training of a student that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, using not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher as hints to improve the training process and final performance of the student. Because the student intermediate hidden layer will generally be smaller than the teacher's intermediate hidden layer, additional parameters are introduced to map the student hidden layer to the prediction of the teacher hidden layer. This allows one to train deeper students that can generalize better or run faster, a trade-off that is controlled by the chosen student capacity. For example, on CIFAR-10, a deep student network with almost 10.4 times less parameters outperforms a larger, state-of-the-art teacher network."
2014,Conditioning and time representation in long short-term memory networks.,"Abstract
Dopaminergic models based on the temporal-difference learning algorithm usually do not differentiate trace from delay conditioning. Instead, they use a fixed temporal representation of elapsed time since conditioned stimulus onset. Recently, a new model was proposed in which timing is learned within a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network representing the cerebral cortex (Rivest et al. in J Comput Neurosci 28(1):107â€“130, 2010). In this paper, that modelâ€™s ability to reproduce and explain relevant data, as well as its ability to make interesting new predictions, are evaluated. The model reveals a strikingly different temporal representation between trace and delay conditioning since trace conditioning requires working memory to remember the past conditioned stimulus while delay conditioning does not. On the other hand, the model predicts no important difference in DA responses between those two conditions when trained on one conditioning paradigm and tested on the other. The model predicts that in trace conditioning, animal timing starts with the conditioned stimulus offset as opposed to its onset. In classical conditioning, it predicts that if the conditioned stimulus does not disappear after the reward, the animal may expect a second reward. Finally, the last simulation reveals that the buildup of activity of some units in the networks can adapt to new delays by adjusting their rate of integration. Most importantly, the paper shows that it is possible, with the proposed architecture, to acquire discharge patterns similar to those observed in dopaminergic neurons and in the cerebral cortex on those tasks simply by minimizing a predictive cost function."
2014,What regularized auto-encoders learn from the data-generating distribution.,"What do auto-encoders learn about the underlying data-generating distribution? Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies some of these previous observations by showing that minimizing a particular form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that locally characterizes the shape of the data-generating density. We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parameterization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function. Finally, we show how an approximate Metropolis-Hastings MCMC can be setup to recover samples from the estimated distribution, and this is confirmed in sampling experiments.

2014,A semantic matching energy function for learning with multi-relational data - Application to word-sense disambiguation.,"Abstract
Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature as well as on data from a real-world knowledge base (WordNet). In addition, we present how our method can be applied to perform word-sense disambiguation in a context of open-text semantic parsing, where the goal is to learn to assign a structured meaning representation to almost any sentence of free text, demonstrating that it can scale up to tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of types of relation."
2014,Learning semantic representations of objects and their parts.,"Abstract
Recently, large scale image annotation datasets have been collected with millions of images and thousands of possible annotations. Latent variable models, or embedding methods, that simultaneously learn semantic representations of object labels and image representations can provide tractable solutions on such tasks. In this work, we are interested in jointly learning representations both for the objects in an image, and the parts of those objects, because such deeper semantic representations could bring a leap forward in image retrieval or browsing. Despite the size of these datasets, the amount of annotated data for objects and parts can be costly and may not be available. In this paper, we propose to bypass this cost with a method able to learn to jointly label objects and parts without requiring exhaustively labeled data. We design a model architecture that can be trained under a proxy supervision obtained by combining standard image annotation (from ImageNet) with semantic part-based within-label relations (from WordNet). The model itself is designed to model both object image to object label similarities, and object label to object part label similarities in a single joint system. Experiments conducted on our combined data and a precisely annotated evaluation set demonstrate the usefulness of our approach."
2014,The Spike-and-Slab RBM and Extensions to Discrete and Sparse Data Distributions.,"Abstract:
The spike-and-slab restricted Boltzmann machine (ssRBM) is defined to have both a real-valued â€œslabâ€ variable and a binary â€œspikeâ€ variable associated with each unit in the hidden layer. The model uses its slab variables to model the conditional covariance of the observation-thought to be important in capturing the statistical properties of natural images. In this paper, we present the canonical ssRBM framework together with some extensions. These extensions highlight the flexibility of the spike-and-slab RBM as a platform for exploring more sophisticated probabilistic models of high dimensional data in general and natural image data in particular. Here, we introduce the subspace-ssRBM focused on the task of learning invariant features. We highlight the behaviour of the ssRBM and its extensions through experiments with the MNIST digit recognition task and the CIFAR-10 object classification task."
2014,On the Challenges of Physical Implementations of RBMs.,"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are powerful machine learning models, but learning and some kinds of inference in the model require sampling-based approximations, which, in classical digital computers, are implemented using expensive MCMC. Physical computation offers the opportunity to reduce the costof sampling by building physical systems whose natural dynamics correspond to drawing samples from the desired RBM distribution. Such a system avoids the burn-in and mixing cost of a Markov chain. However, hardware implementations of this variety usually entail limitations such as low-precision and limited range of the parameters and restrictions on the size and topology of the RBM. We conduct software simulations to determine how harmful each of these restrictions is. Our simulations are based on the D-Wave Two computer, but the issues we investigate arise in most forms of physical computation.Our findings suggest that designers of new physical computing hardware and algorithms for physical computers should focus their efforts on overcoming the limitations imposed by the topology restrictions of currently existing physical computers."
2014,Learning Concept Embeddings for Query Expansion by Quantum Entropy Minimization.,"In web search, users queries are formulated using only few terms and term-matching retrieval functions could fail at retrieving relevant documents. Given a user query, the technique of query expansion (QE) consists in selecting related terms that could enhance the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents. Selecting such expansion terms is challenging and requires a computational framework capable of encoding complex semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning, in a supervised way, semantic representations for words and phrases. By embedding queries and documents in special matrices, our model disposes of an increased representational power with respect to existing approaches adopting a vector representation. We show that our model produces high-quality query expansion terms. Our expansion increase IR measures beyond expansion from current word-embeddings models and well-established traditional QE methods."
2014,Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation.,"In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN EncoderDecoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases."
2014,Deep learning and cultural evolution.,"ABSTRACT
We propose a theory and its first experimental tests, relating difficulty of learning in deep architectures to culture and language. The theory is articulated around the following hypotheses: learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective local minima, particularly when it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, which are represented by the composition of many levels of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; a human brain can learn such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans, which act as hints for intermediate and higher-level abstractions; language and the recombination and optimization of mental concepts provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator for this purpose. The theory is grounded in experimental observations of the difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks and an empirical test of the hypothesis regarding the need for guidance of intermediate concepts is demonstrated. This is done through a learning task on which all the tested machine learning algorithms failed, unless provided with hints about intermediate-level abstractions."
2014,Deep Generative Stochastic Networks Trainable by Backprop.,"We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."
2014,Marginalized Denoising Auto-encoders for Nonlinear Representations.,"Denoising auto-encoders (DAEs) have been successfully used to learn new representations for a wide range of machine learning tasks. During training, DAEs make many passes over the training dataset and reconstruct it from partial corruption generated from a pre-specified corrupting distribution. This process learns robust representation, though at the expense of requiring many training epochs, in which the data is explicitly corrupted. In this paper we present the marginalized Denoising Auto-encoder (mDAE), which (approximately) marginalizes out the corruption during training. Effectively, the mDAE takes into account infinitely many corrupted copies of the training data in every epoch, and therefore is able to match or outperform the DAE with much fewer training epochs. We analyze our proposed algorithm and show that it can be understood as a classic auto-encoder with a special form of regularization. In empirical evaluations we show that it attains 1-2 order-of-magnitude speedup in training time over other competing approaches."
2014,Scaling up deep learning.,"Deep learning has rapidly moved from a marginal approach in the machine learning community less than ten years ago to one that has strong industrial impact, in particular for high-dimensional perceptual data such as speech and images, but also natural language. The demand for experts in deep learning is growing very fast (faster than we can graduate PhDs), thereby considerably increasing their market value. Deep learning is based on the idea of learning multiple levels of representation, with higher levels computed as a function of lower levels, and corresponding to more abstract concepts automatically discovered by the learner. Deep learning arose out of research on artificial neural networks and graphical models and the literature on that subject has considerably grown in recent years, culminating in the creation of a dedicated conference (ICLR). The tutorial will introduce some of the basic algorithms, both on the supervised and unsupervised sides, as well as discuss some of the guidelines for successfully using them in practice. Finally, it will introduce current research questions regarding the challenge of scaling up deep learning to much larger models that can successfully extract information from huge datasets.

2014,Iterative Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator NADE-k.,"Training of the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) can be viewed as doing one step of probabilistic inference on missing values in data. We propose a new model that extends this inference scheme to multiple steps, arguing that it is easier to learn to improve a reconstruction in k
steps rather than to learn to reconstruct in a single inference step. The proposed model is an unsupervised building block for deep learning that combines the desirable properties of NADE and multi-predictive training: (1) Its test likelihood can be computed analytically, (2) it is easy to generate independent samples from it, and (3) it uses an inference engine that is a superset of variational inference for Boltzmann machines. The proposed NADE-k is competitive with the state-of-the-art in density estimation on the two datasets tested."
2014,Generative Adversarial Nets.,"We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via adversarial nets, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples."
2014,On the Number of Linear Regions of Deep Neural Networks.,"We study the complexity of functions computable by deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations in terms of the symmetries and the number of linear regions that they have. Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer's input-space to the same output. In this way, deep models compute functions that react equally to complicated patterns of different inputs. The compositional structure of these functions enables them to re-use pieces of computation exponentially often in terms of the network's depth. This paper investigates the complexity of such compositional maps and contributes new theoretical results regarding the advantage of depth for neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In particular, our analysis is not specific to a single family of models, and as an example, we employ it for rectifier and maxout networks. We improve complexity bounds from pre-existing work and investigate the behavior of units in higher layers."
2014,Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization.,"A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance."
2014,How transferable are features in deep neural networks?,"Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset."
2014,On the Equivalence between Deep NADE and Generative Stochastic Networks.,"Abstract
Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimators (NADEs) have recently been shown as successful alternatives for modeling high dimensional multimodal distributions. One issue associated with NADEs is that they rely on a particular order of factorization for P(x). This issue has been recently addressed by a variant of NADE called Orderless NADEs and its deeper version, Deep Orderless NADE. Orderless NADEs are trained based on a criterion that stochastically maximizes P(x) with all possible orders of factorizations. Unfortunately, ancestral sampling from deep NADE is very expensive, corresponding to running through a neural net separately predicting each of the visible variables given some others. This work makes a connection between this criterion and the training criterion for Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs). It shows that training NADEs in this way also trains a GSN, which defines a Markov chain associated with the NADE model. Based on this connection, we show an alternative way to sample from a trained Orderless NADE that allows to trade-off computing time and quality of the samples: a 3 to 10-fold speedup (taking into account the waste due to correlations between consecutive samples of the chain) can be obtained without noticeably reducing the quality of the samples. This is achieved using a novel sampling procedure for GSNs called annealed GSN sampling, similar to tempering methods that combines fast mixing (obtained thanks to steps at high noise levels) with accurate samples (obtained thanks to steps at low noise levels)."
2014,Learned-Norm Pooling for Deep Feedforward and Recurrent Neural Networks.,"Abstract
In this paper we propose and investigate a novel nonlinear unit, called L p unit, for deep neural networks. The proposed L p unit receives signals from several projections of a subset of units in the layer below and computes a normalized L p norm. We notice two interesting interpretations of the L p unit. First, the proposed unit can be understood as a generalization of a number of conventional pooling operators such as average, root-mean-square and max pooling widely used in, for instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN), HMAX models and neocognitrons. Furthermore, the L p unit is, to a certain degree, similar to the recently proposed maxout unit [13] which achieved the state-of-the-art object recognition results on a number of benchmark datasets. Secondly, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the activation function based on which we argue that the L p unit is more efficient at representing complex, nonlinear separating boundaries. Each L p unit defines a superelliptic boundary, with its exact shape defined by the order p. We claim that this makes it possible to model arbitrarily shaped, curved boundaries more efficiently by combining a few L p units of different orders. This insight justifies the need for learning different orders for each unit in the model. We empirically evaluate the proposed L p units on a number of datasets and show that multilayer perceptrons (MLP) consisting of the L p units achieve the state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed L p unit on the recently proposed deep recurrent neural networks (RNN)."
2014,Overcoming the Curse of Sentence Length for Neural Machine Translation using Automatic Segmentation.,"The authors of (Cho et al., 2014a) have shown that the recently introduced neural network translation systems suffer from a significant drop in translation quality when translating long sentences, unlike existing phrase-based translation systems. In this paper, we propose a way to address this issue by automatically segmenting an input sentence into phrases that can be easily translated by the neural network translation model. Once each segment has been independently translated by the neural machine translation model, the translated clauses are concatenated to form a final translation. Empirical results show a significant improvement in translation quality for long sentences."
2014,On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder Approaches.,"Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically."
2014,Bounding the Test Log-Likelihood of Generative Models.,"Several interesting generative learning algorithms involve a complex probability distribution over many random variables, involving intractable normalization constants or latent variable normalization. Some of them may even not have an analytic expression for the unnormalized probability function and no tractable approximation. This makes it difficult to estimate the quality of these models, once they have been trained, or to monitor their quality (e.g. for early stopping) while training. A previously proposed method is based on constructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability function from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a more efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true test log-likelihood, and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated samples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor mixing. We further propose a biased variant of the estimator that can be used reliably with a finite number of samples for the purpose of model comparison."
2014,An Empirical Investigation of Catastrophic Forgeting in Gradient-Based Neural Networks.,"Catastrophic forgetting is a problem faced by many machine learning models and algorithms. When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models ""forget"" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm--the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated."
2014,Multimodal Transitions for Generative Stochastic Networks.,"Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs) have been recently introduced as an alternative to traditional probabilistic modeling: instead of parametrizing the data distribution directly, one parametrizes a transition operator for a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is an estimator of the data generating distribution. The result of training is therefore a machine that generates samples through this Markov chain. However, the previously introduced GSN consistency theorems suggest that in order to capture a wide class of distributions, the transition operator in general should be multimodal, something that has not been done before this paper. We introduce for the first time multimodal transition distributions for GSNs, in particular using models in the NADE family (Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator) as output distributions of the transition operator. A NADE model is related to an RBM (and can thus model multimodal distributions) but its likelihood (and likelihood gradient) can be computed easily. The parameters of the NADE are obtained as a learned function of the previous state of the learned Markov chain. Experiments clearly illustrate the advantage of such multimodal transition distributions over unimodal GSNs."
2014,How to Construct Deep Recurrent Neural Networks.,"In this paper, we explore different ways to extend a recurrent neural network (RNN) to a \textit{deep} RNN. We start by arguing that the concept of depth in an RNN is not as clear as it is in feedforward neural networks. By carefully analyzing and understanding the architecture of an RNN, however, we find three points of an RNN which may be made deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2) hidden-to-hidden transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. Based on this observation, we propose two novel architectures of a deep RNN which are orthogonal to an earlier attempt of stacking multiple recurrent layers to build a deep RNN (Schmidhuber, 1992; El Hihi and Bengio, 1996). We provide an alternative interpretation of these deep RNNs using a novel framework based on neural operators. The proposed deep RNNs are empirically evaluated on the tasks of polyphonic music prediction and language modeling. The experimental result supports our claim that the proposed deep RNNs benefit from the depth and outperform the conventional, shallow RNNs."
2014,On the number of inference regions of deep feed forward networks with piece-wise linear activations.,"This paper explores the complexity of deep feedforward networks with linear pre-synaptic couplings and rectified linear activations. This is a contribution to the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and shallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for comparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piecewise linear functions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep rectifier multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a single layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime, when the number of inputs stays constant, if the shallow model has
kn

n

2014,An empirical analysis of dropout in piecewise linear networks.,"The recently introduced dropout training criterion for neural networks has been the subject of much attention due to its simplicity and remarkable effectiveness as a regularizer, as well as its interpretation as a training procedure for an exponentially large ensemble of networks that share parameters. In this work we empirically investigate several questions related to the efficacy of dropout, specifically as it concerns networks employing the popular rectified linear activation function. We investigate the quality of the test time weight-scaling inference procedure by evaluating the geometric average exactly in small models, as well as compare the performance of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean more commonly employed by ensemble techniques. We explore the effect of tied weights on the ensemble interpretation by training ensembles of masked networks without tied weights. Finally, we investigate an alternative criterion based on a biased estimator of the maximum likelihood ensemble gradient."
2014,Revisiting Natural Gradient for Deep Networks.,"We evaluate natural gradient, an algorithm originally proposed in Amari (1997), for learning deep models. The contributions of this paper are as follows. We show the connection between natural gradient and three other recently proposed methods for training deep models: Hessian-Free (Martens, 2010), Krylov Subspace Descent (Vinyals and Povey, 2012) and TONGA (Le Roux et al., 2008). We describe how one can use unlabeled data to improve the generalization error obtained by natural gradient and empirically evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to the ordering of the training set compared to stochastic gradient descent. Finally we extend natural gradient to incorporate second order information alongside the manifold information and provide a benchmark of the new algorithm using a truncated Newton approach for inverting the metric matrix instead of using a diagonal approximation of it."
2013,Learning Deep Physiological Models of Affect.,"Abstract:
Feature extraction and feature selection are crucial phases in the process of affective modeling. Both, however, incorporate substantial limitations that hinder the development of reliable and accurate models of affect. For the purpose of modeling affect manifested through physiology, this paper builds on recent advances in machine learning with deep learning (DL) approaches. The efficiency of DL algorithms that train artificial neural network models is tested and compared against standard feature extraction and selection approaches followed in the literature. Results on a game data corpus - containing players' physiological signals (i.e., skin conductance and blood volume pulse) and subjective self-reports of affect - reveal that DL outperforms manual ad-hoc feature extraction as it yields significantly more accurate affective models. Moreover, it appears that DL meets and even outperforms affective models that are boosted by automatic feature selection, for several of the scenarios examined. As the DL method is generic and applicable to any affective modeling task, the key findings of the paper suggest that ad-hoc feature extraction and selection - to a lesser degree - could be bypassed."
2013,Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives.,"Abstract:
The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning."
2013,Scaling Up Spike-and-Slab Models for Unsupervised Feature Learning.,"We describe the use of two spike-and-slab models for modeling real-valued data, with an emphasis on their applications to object recognition. The first model, which we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C), is a preexisting model for which we introduce a faster approximate inference algorithm. We introduce a deep variant of S3C, which we call the partially directed deep Boltzmann machine (PD-DBM) and extend our S3C inference algorithm for use on this model. We describe learning procedures for each. We demonstrate that our inference procedure for S3C enables scaling the model to unprecedented large problem sizes, and demonstrate that using S3C as a feature extractor results in very good object recognition performance, particularly when the number of labeled examples is low. We show that the PD-DBM generates better samples than its shallow counterpart, and that unlike DBMs or DBNs, the PD-DBM may be trained successfully without greedy layerwise training."
2013,Texture Modeling with Convolutional Spike-and-Slab RBMs and Deep Extensions.,We apply the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) to texture modeling. The ssRBM with tiled-convolution weight sharing (TssRBM) achieves or surpasses the state-of-the-art on texture synthesis and inpainting by parametric models. We also develop a novel RBM model with a spike-and-slab visible layer and binary variables in the hidden layer. This model is designed to be stacked on top of the ssRBM. We show the resulting deep belief network (DBN) is a powerful generative model that improves on single-layer models and is capable of modeling not only single high-resolution and challenging textures but also multiple textures with fixed-size filters in the bottom layer.
2013,Stacked calibration of off-policy policy evaluation for video game matchmaking.,"Abstract:
We consider an industrial strength application of recommendation systems for video-game matchmaking in which off-policy policy evaluation is important but where standard approaches can hardly be applied. The objective of the policy is to sequentially form teams of players from those waiting to be matched, in such a way as to produce well-balanced matches. Unfortunately, the available training data comes from a policy that is not known perfectly and that is not stochastic, making it impossible to use methods based on importance weights. Furthermore, we observe that when the estimated reward function and the policy are obtained by training from the same off-policy dataset, the policy evaluation using the estimated reward function is biased. We present a simple calibration procedure that is similar to stacked regression and that removes most of the bias, in the experiments we performed. Data collected during beta tests of Ghost Recon Online, a first person shooter from Ubisoft, were used for the experiments."
2013,High-dimensional sequence transduction.,"Abstract:
We investigate the problem of transforming an input sequence into a high-dimensional output sequence in order to transcribe polyphonic audio music into symbolic notation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a recurrent neural network that is able to learn realistic output distributions given the input and we devise an efficient algorithm to search for the global mode of that distribution. The resulting method produces musically plausible transcriptions even under high levels of noise and drastically outperforms previous state-of- the-art approaches on five datasets of synthesized sounds and real recordings, approximately halving the test error rate."
2013,Advances in optimizing recurrent networks.,"Abstract:
After a more than decade-long period of relatively little research activity in the area of recurrent neural networks, several new developments will be reviewed here that have allowed substantial progress both in understanding and in technical solutions towards more efficient training of recurrent networks. These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms of modeling sequences, their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error."
2013,Combining modality specific deep neural networks for emotion recognition in video.,"ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the techniques used for the University of MontrÃ©al's team submissions to the 2013 Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge. The challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the primary human subject in short video clips extracted from feature length movies. This involves the analysis of video clips of acted scenes lasting approximately one-two seconds, including the audio track which may contain human voices as well as background music. Our approach combines multiple deep neural networks for different data modalities, including: (1) a deep convolutional neural network for the analysis of facial expressions within video frames; (2) a deep belief net to capture audio information; (3) a deep autoencoder to model the spatio-temporal information produced by the human actions depicted within the entire scene; and (4) a shallow network architecture focused on extracted features of the mouth of the primary human subject in the scene. We discuss each of these techniques, their performance characteristics and different strategies to aggregate their predictions. Our best single model was a convolutional neural network trained to predict emotions from static frames using two large data sets, the Toronto Face Database and our own set of faces images harvested from Google image search, followed by a per frame aggregation strategy that used the challenge training data. This yielded a test set accuracy of 35.58%. Using our best strategy for aggregating our top performing models into a single predictor we were able to produce an accuracy of 41.03% on the challenge test set. These compare favorably to the challenge baseline test set accuracy of 27.56%."
2013,Better Mixing via Deep Representations.,"It has been hypothesized, and supported with experimental evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce Markov chains that mix faster between modes. Consequently, mixing between modes would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand this, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing between modes and interpolating between samples."
2013,On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks.,"There are two widely known issues with properly training recurrent neural networks, the vanishing and the exploding gradient problems detailed in Bengio et al. (1994). In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section."
2013,Maxout Networks.,"We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN."
2013,Challenges in Representation Learning: A Report on Three Machine Learning Contests.,"Abstract
The ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning focused on three challenges: the black box learning challenge, the facial expression recognition challenge, and the multimodal learning challenge. We describe the datasets created for these challenges and summarize the results of the competitions. We provide suggestions for organizers of future challenges and some comments on what kind of knowledge can be gained from machine learning competitions."
2013,Unsupervised Learning of Semantics of Object Detections for Scene Categorization.,"Abstract
Classifying scenes (e.g. into â€œstreetâ€, â€œhomeâ€ or â€œleisureâ€) is an important but complicated task nowadays, because images come with variability, ambiguity, and a wide range of illumination or scale conditions. Standard approaches build an intermediate representation of the global image and learn classifiers on it. Recently, it has been proposed to depict an image as an aggregation of its contained objects:  the representation on which classifiers are trained is composed of many heterogeneous feature vectors derived from various object detectors. In this paper, we propose to study different approaches to efficiently learn contextual semantics out of these object detections. We use the features provided by Object-Bank [24] (177 different object detectors producing 252 attributes each), and show on several benchmarks for scene categorization that careful combinations, taking into account the structure of the data, allows to greatly improve over original results (from
+5
+
to
+11%
+
) while drastically reducing the dimensionality of the representation by 97 % (from 44,604 to 1,000). We also show that the uncertainty relative to object detectors hampers the use of external semantic knowledge to improve detectors combination, unlike our unsupervised learning approach."

Standard approaches build an intermediate representation of the global image and learn classifiers on it.

2013,Investigation of recurrent-neural-network architectures and learning methods for spoken language understanding.,"One of the key problems in spoken language understanding (SLU) is the task of slot filling. In light of the recent success of applying deep neural network technologies in domain detection and intent identification, we carried out an in-depth investigation on the use of recurrent neural networks for the more difficult task of slot filling involving sequence discrimination. In this work, we implemented and compared several important recurrent-neural-network architectures, including the Elman-type and Jordan-type recurrent networks and their variants. To make the results easy to reproduce and compare, we implemented these networks on the common Theano neural network toolkit, and evaluated them on the ATIS benchmark. We also compared our results to a conditional random fields (CRF) baseline. Our results show that on this task, both types of recurrent networks outperform the CRF baseline substantially, and a bi-directional Jordan-type network that takes into account both past and future dependencies among slots works best, outperforming a CRF-based baseline by 14% in relative error reduction.
"
2013,Audio Chord Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks.,"In this paper, we present an audio chord recognition system based on a recurrent neural network. The audio features are obtained from a deep neural network optimized with a combination of chromagram targets and chord information, and aggregated over different time scales. Contrarily to other existing approaches, our system incorporates acoustic and musicological models under a single training objective. We devise an efficient algorithm to search for the global mode of the output distribution while taking long-term dependencies into account. The resulting method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on the MIREX dataset in the major/minor prediction task."
2013,Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines.,"We introduce the Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machine (MP-DBM). The MP-DBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classification tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classification, classification with missing inputs, and mean field prediction tasks."
2013,Generalized Denoising Auto-Encoders as Generative Models.,"Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data generating density, in the case where the corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."
2013,Stochastic Ratio Matching of RBMs for Sparse High-Dimensional Inputs.,"Sparse high-dimensional data vectors are common in many application domains where a very large number of rarely non-zero features can be devised. Unfortunately, this creates a computational bottleneck for unsupervised feature learning algorithms such as those based on auto-encoders and RBMs, because they involve a reconstruction step where the whole input vector is predicted from the current feature values. An algorithm was recently developed to successfully handle the case of auto-encoders, based on an importance sampling scheme stochastically selecting which input elements to actually reconstruct during training for each particular example. To generalize this idea to RBMs, we propose a stochastic ratio-matching algorithm that inherits all the computational advantages and unbiasedness of the importance sampling scheme. We show that stochastic ratio matching is a good estimator, allowing the approach to beat the state-of-the-art on two bag-of-word text classification benchmarks (20 Newsgroups and RCV1), while keeping computational cost linear in the number of non-zeros."
2013,Modeling term dependencies with quantum language models for IR.,"Traditional information retrieval (IR) models use bag-of-words as the basic representation and assume that some form of independence holds between terms. Representing term dependencies and defining a scoring function capable of integrating such additional evidence is theoretically and practically challenging. Recently, Quantum Theory (QT) has been proposed as a possible, more general framework for IR. However, only a limited number of investigations have been made and the potential of QT has not been fully explored and tested. We develop a new, generalized Language Modeling approach for IR by adopting the probabilistic framework of QT. In particular, quantum probability could account for both single and compound terms at once without having to extend the term space artificially as in previous studies. This naturally allows us to avoid the weight-normalization problem, which arises in the current practice by mixing scores from matching compound terms and from matching single terms. Our model is the first practical application of quantum probability to show significant improvements over a robust bag-of-words baseline and achieves better performance on a stronger non bag-of-words baseline.

2013,Deep Learning of Representations: Looking Forward.,"Abstract
Deep learning research aims at discovering learning algorithms that discover multiple levels of distributed representations, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. Although the study of deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges."
2013,Regularized Auto-Encoders Estimate Local Statistics.,"What do auto-encoders learn about the underlying data generating distribution? Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies some of these previous observations by showing that minimizing a particular form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that locally characterizes the shape of the data generating density. We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parametrization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function. Finally, we show how an approximate Metropolis-Hastings MCMC can be setup to recover samples from the estimated distribution, and this is confirmed in sampling experiments."
2013,A Semantic Matching Energy Function for Learning with Multi-relational Data.,"Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature."
2013,Metric-Free Natural Gradient for Joint-Training of Boltzmann Machines.,"This paper introduces the Metric-Free Natural Gradient (MFNG) algorithm for training Boltzmann Machines. Similar in spirit to the Hessian-Free method of Martens [8], our algorithm belongs to the family of truncated Newton methods and exploits an efficient matrix-vector product to avoid explicitely storing the natural gradient metric
L
. This metric is shown to be the expected second derivative of the log-partition function (under the model distribution), or equivalently, the variance of the vector of partial derivatives of the energy function. We evaluate our method on the task of joint-training a 3-layer Deep Boltzmann Machine and show that MFNG does indeed have faster per-epoch convergence compared to Stochastic Maximum Likelihood with centering, though wall-clock performance is currently not competitive."
2013,Joint Training Deep Boltzmann Machines for Classification.,"We introduce a new method for training deep Boltzmann machines jointly. Prior methods of training DBMs require an initial learning pass that trains the model greedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classification tasks. In our approach, we train all layers of the DBM simultaneously, using a novel training procedure called multi-prediction training. The resulting model can either be interpreted as a single generative model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent networks that share parameters and may be approximately averaged together using a novel technique we call the multi-inference trick. We show that our approach performs competitively for classification and outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy of approximate inference and classification with missing inputs."
2013,Big Neural Networks Waste Capacity.,"This article exposes the failure of some big neural networks to leverage added capacity to reduce underfitting. Past research suggest diminishing returns when increasing the size of neural networks. Our experiments on ImageNet LSVRC-2010 show that this may be due to the fact there are highly diminishing returns for capacity in terms of training error, leading to underfitting. This suggests that the optimization method - first order gradient descent - fails at this regime. Directly attacking this problem, either through the optimization method or the choices of parametrization, may allow to improve the generalization error on large datasets, for which a large capacity is required."
2013,Natural Gradient Revisited.,"The aim of this paper is three-fold. First we show that Hessian-Free (Martens, 2010) and Krylov Subspace Descent (Vinyals and Povey, 2012) can be described as implementations of natural gradient descent due to their use of the extended Gauss-Newton approximation of the Hessian. Secondly we re-derive natural gradient from basic principles, contrasting the difference between two versions of the algorithm found in the neural network literature, as well as highlighting a few differences between natural gradient and typical second order methods. Lastly we show empirically that natural gradient can be robust to overfitting and particularly it can be robust to the order in which the training data is presented to the model."
2013,Knowledge Matters: Importance of Prior Information for Optimization.,"We explore the effect of introducing prior information into the intermediate level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima."
2012,Detonation Classification from acoustic Signature with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine.,"We compare the recently proposed Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM) to the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a challenging classification task consisting in identifying weapon classes from audio signals. The three weapon classes considered in this work (mortar, rocket, and rocket?propelled grenade), are difficult to reliably classify with standard techniques because they tend to have similar acoustic signatures. In addition, specificities of the data available in this study make it challenging to rigorously compare classifiers, and we address methodological issues arising from this situation. Experiments show good classification accuracy that could make these techniques suitable for fielding on autonomous devices. DRBMs appear to yield better accuracy than SVMs, and are less sensitive to the choice of signal preprocessing and model hyperparameters. This last property is especially appealing in such a task where the lack of data makes model validation difficult.

2012,Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization.,"Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ""High Throughput"" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms."
2012,Learning Algorithms for the Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine.,"Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to extract useful features from input data or construct deep artificial neural networks. In such settings, the RBM only yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classification performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning.

2012,Beyond Skill Rating: Advanced Matchmaking in Ghost Recon Online.,"Abstract:
Player satisfaction is particularly difficult to ensure in online games, due to interactions with other players. In adversarial multiplayer games, matchmaking typically consists in trying to match together players of similar skill level. However, this is usually based on a single-skill value, and assumes the only factor of â€œfunâ€ is the game balance. We present a more advanced matchmaking strategy developed for Ghost Recon Online, an upcoming team-focused first-person shooter (FPS) from Ubisoft (Montreal, QC, Canada). We first show how incorporating more information about players than their raw skill can lead to more balanced matches. We also argue that balance is not the only factor that matters, and present a strategy to explicitly maximize the players' fun, taking advantage of a rich player profile that includes information about player behavior and personal preferences. Ultimately, our goal is to ask players to provide direct feedback on match quality through an in-game survey. However, because such data were not available for this study, we rely here on heuristics tailored to this specific game. Experiments on data collected during Ghost Recon Online's beta tests show that neural networks can effectively be used to predict both balance and player enjoyment."
2012,Disentangling Factors of Variation for Facial Expression Recognition.,"Abstract
We propose a semi-supervised approach to solve the task of emotion recognition in 2D face images using recent ideas in deep learning for handling the factors of variation present in data. An emotion classification algorithm should be both robust to (1) remaining variations due to the pose of the face in the image after centering and alignment, (2) the identity or morphology of the face. In order to achieve this invariance, we propose to learn a hierarchy of features in which we gradually filter the factors of variation arising from both (1) and (2). We address (1) by using a multi-scale contractive convolutional network (CCNET) in order to obtain invariance to translations of the facial traits in the image. Using the feature representation produced by the CCNET, we train a Contractive Discriminative Analysis (CDA) feature extractor, a novel variant of the Contractive Auto-Encoder (CAE), designed to learn a representation separating out the emotion-related factors from the others (which mostly capture the subject identity, and what is left of pose after the CCNET). This system beats the state-of-the-art on a recently proposed dataset for facial expression recognition, the Toronto Face Database, moving the state-of-art accuracy from 82.4% to 85.0%, while the CCNET and CDA improve accuracy of a standard CAE by 8%."
2012,Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription.,We investigate the problem of modeling symbolic sequences of polyphonic music in a completely general piano-roll representation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on distribution estimators conditioned on a recurrent neural network that is able to discover temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences. Our approach outperforms many traditional models of polyphonic music on a variety of realistic datasets. We show how our musical language model can serve as a symbolic prior to improve the accuracy of polyphonic transcription.
2012,Large-Scale Feature Learning With Spike-and-Slab Sparse Coding.,"We consider the problem of object recognition with a large number of classes. In order to overcome the low amount of labeled examples available in this setting, we introduce a new feature learning and extraction procedure based on a factor model we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C). Prior work on S3C has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale S3C to the enormous problem sizes needed for object recognition. We present a novel inference procedure for appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors that S3C may be trained with. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use the CIFAR-100 dataset to demonstrate that our method scales to large numbers of classes better than previous methods. Finally, we use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge."
2012,A Generative Process for Contractive Auto-Encoders.,"The contractive auto-encoder learns a representation of the input data that captures the local manifold structure around each data point, through the leading singular vectors of the Jacobian of the transformation from input to representation. The corresponding singular values specify how much local variation is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while remaining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples that are consistent with the local structure captured by a contractive auto-encoder. The associated stochastic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly and mix well between modes, compared to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure can also be used to train the second layer of contraction that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of variation discovered in the first layer. We show that this can help learn and represent invariances present in the data and improve classification error."
2012,Discriminative Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Multiple Pitch Estimation.,"In this paper, we present a supervised method to improve the multiple pitch estimation accuracy of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. The idea is to extend the sparse NMF framework by incorporating pitch information present in time-aligned musical scores in order to extract features that enforce the separability between pitch labels. We introduce two discriminative criteria that maximize inter-class scatter and quantify the predictive potential of a given decomposition using logistic regressors. Those criteria are applied to both the latent variable and the deterministic autoencoder views of NMF, and we devise efficient update rules for each. We evaluate our method on three polyphonic datasets of piano recordings and orchestral instrument mixes. Both models greatly enhance the quality of the basis spectra learned by NMF and the accuracy of multiple pitch estimation."
2012,Building Musically-relevant Audio Features through Multiple Timescale Representations.,"Low-level aspects of music audio such as timbre, loudness and pitch, can be relatively well modelled by features extracted from short-time windows. Higher-level aspects such as melody, harmony, phrasing and rhythm, on the other hand, are salient only at larger timescales and require a better representation of time dynamics. For various music information retrieval tasks, one would benefit from modelling both low and high level aspects in a unified feature extraction framework. By combining adaptive features computed at different timescales, short-timescale events are put in context by detecting longer timescale features. In this paper, we describe a method to obtain such multi-scale features and evaluate its effectiveness for automatic tag annotation. "
2012,Deep Learning of Representations for Unsupervised and Transfer Learning.,"Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher-level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution
P(x)
P
is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting
P(y|x)
P
. This paper focuses on the context of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution."
2012,Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge: a Deep Learning Approach.,"Learning good representations from a large set of unlabeled data is a particularly challenging task. Recent work (see Bengio (2009) for a review) shows that training deep architectures is a good way to extract such representations, by extracting and disentangling gradually higher-level factors of variation characterizing the input distribution. In this paper, we describe different kinds of layers we trained for learning representations in the setting of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge. The strategy of our team won the final phase of the challenge. It combined and stacked different one-layer unsupervised learning algorithms, adapted to each of the five datasets of the competition. This paper describes that strategy and the particular one-layer learning algorithms feeding a simple linear classifier with a tiny number of labeled training samples (1 to 64 per class)."
2012,Joint Learning of Words and Meaning Representations for Open-Text Semantic Parsing.,"Open-text semantic parsers are designed to interpret any statement in natural language by inferring a corresponding meaning representation (MR - a formal representation of its sense). Unfortunately, large scale systems cannot be easily machine-learned due to lack of directly supervised data. We propose a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70,000 words mapped to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning from raw text. The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data. Hence, the system ends up providing methods for knowledge acquisition and word-sense disambiguation within the context of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework. Experiments on these various tasks indicate the promise of the approach."
2011,Suitability of V1 Energy Models for Object Classification.,"Simulations of cortical computation have often focused on networks built from simplified neuron models similar to rate models hypothesized for V1 simple cells. However, physiological research has revealed that even V1 simple cells have surprising complexity. Our computational simulations explore the effect of this complexity on the visual system's ability to solve simple tasks, such as the categorization of shapes and digits, after learning from a limited number of examples. We use recently proposed high-throughput methodology to explore what axes of modeling complexity are useful in these categorization tasks. We find that complex cell rate models learn to categorize objects better than simple cell models, and without incurring extra computational expense. We find that the squaring of linear filter responses leads to better performance. We find that several other components of physiologically derived models do not yield better performance.

2011,Quickly Generating Representative Samples from an RBM-Derived Process.,"Two recently proposed learning algorithms, herding and fast persistent contrastive divergence (FPCD), share the following interesting characteristic: they exploit changes in the model parameters while sampling in order to escape modes and mix better during the sampling process that is part of the learning algorithm. We justify such approaches as ways to escape modes while keeping approximately the same asymptotic distribution of the Markov chain. In that spirit, we extend FPCD using an idea borrowed from Herding in order to obtain a pure sampling algorithm, which we call the rates-FPCD sampler. Interestingly, this sampler can improve the model as we collect more samples, since it optimizes a lower bound on the log likelihood of the training data. We provide empirical evidence that this new algorithm displays substantially better and more robust mixing than Gibbs sampling.

2011,Contextual tag inference.,"This article examines the use of two kinds of context to improve the results of content-based music taggers: the relationships between tags and between the clips of songs that are tagged. We show that users agree more on tags applied to clips temporally “closer” to one another; that conditional restricted Boltzmann machine models of tags can more accurately predict related tags when they take context into account; and that when training data is “smoothed” using context, support vector machines can better rank these clips according to the original, unsmoothed tags and do this more accurately than three standard multi-label classifiers.

2011,Learning Structured Embeddings of Knowledge Bases.,"Many Knowledge Bases (KBs) are now readily available and encompass colossal quantities of information thanks to either a long-term funding effort (e.g. WordNet, OpenCyc) or a collaborative process (e.g. Freebase, DBpedia). However, each of them is based on a different rigorous symbolic framework which makes it hard to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like nat- ural language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding, ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily used in recent machine learning meth- ods for prediction and information retrieval. We illustrate our method on WordNet and Freebase and also present a way to adapt it to knowledge extraction from raw text."
2011,On the Expressive Power of Deep Architectures.,"Abstract
Deep architectures are families of functions corresponding to deep circuits. Deep Learning algorithms are based on parametrizing such circuits and tuning their parameters so as to approximately optimize some training objective. Whereas it was thought too difficult to train deep architectures, several successful algorithms have been proposed in recent years. We review some of the theoretical motivations for deep architectures, as well as some of their practical successes, and propose directions of investigations to address some of the remaining challenges."

2011,Domain Adaptation for Large-Scale Sentiment Classification: A Deep Learning Approach.,"The exponential increase in the availability of online reviews and recommendations makes sentiment classification an interesting topic in academic and industrial research. Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains."
2011,Contractive Auto-Encoders: Explicit Invariance During Feature Extraction.,"We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining."
2011,Large-Scale Learning of Embeddings with Reconstruction Sampling.,"In this paper, we present a novel method to speed up the learning of embeddings for large-scale learning tasks involving very sparse data, as is typically the case for Natural Language Processing tasks. Our speed-up method has been developed in the context of Denoising Auto-encoders, which are trained in a purely unsupervised way to capture the input distribution, and learn embeddings for words and text similar to earlier neural language models. The main contribution is a new method to approximate reconstruction error by a sampling procedure. We show how this approximation can be made to obtain an unbiased estimator of the training criterion, and we show how it can be leveraged to make learning much more computationally efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on the Amazon and RCV1 NLP datasets. Instead of reducing vocabulary size to make learning practical, our method allows us to train using very large vocabularies. In particular, reconstruction sampling requires 22x less training time on the full Amazon dataset."
2011,Unsupervised Models of Images by Spike and-Slab RBMs.,"The spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is defined by having both a real valued ""slab"" variable and a binary ""spike"" variable associated with each unit in the hidden layer. In this paper we generalize and extend the spike-and-slab RBM to include non-zero means of the conditional distribution over the observed variables given the binary spike variables. We also introduce a term, quadratic in the observed data that we exploit to guarantee that all conditionals associated with the model are well defined – a guarantee that was absent in the original spike-and-slab RBM. The inclusion of these generalizations improves the performance of the spike-and-slab RBM as a feature learner and achieves competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. The spike-and-slab model, when trained in a convolutional configuration, can generate sensible samples that demonstrate that the model has captured the broad statistical structure of natural images."
2011,Temporal Pooling and Multiscale Learning for Automatic Annotation and Ranking of Music Audio.,"This paper analyzes some of the challenges in performing automatic annotation and ranking of music audio, and proposes a few improvements. First, we motivate the use of principal component analysis on the mel-scaled spectrum. Secondly, we present an analysis of the impact of the selection of pooling functions for summarization of the features over time. We show that combining several pooling functions improves the performance of the system. Finally, we introduce the idea of multiscale learning. By incorporating these ideas in our model, we obtained state-of-the-art performance on the Magnatagatune dataset."
2011,On learning distributed representations of semantics.,"Machine learning algorithms try to characterize configurations of variables that are plausible (somehow similar to those seen in the training set, and predictive of those that could be seen in a test set) so as to be able to answer questions about these configurations. A general approach towards this goal is to learn *representations* of these configurations that help to generalize to new configurations. We expose the statistical advantages of representations that are *distributed* and *deep* (at multiple levels of representation) and survey some of the advances in such feature learning algorithms, along with some of our recent work in this area, for natural language processing and pattern recognition. In particular, we highlight our effort towards modeling semantics beyond single-word embeddings, to capture relations between concepts and produce models of 2-argument relations such as (subject, verb, object) seen as (argument1, relation, argument2) that can be used to answer questions, disambiguate text, and learn from free text and knowledge bases in the same representational space.

2011,Shallow vs. Deep Sum-Product Networks.,"We investigate the representational power of sum-product networks (computation networks analogous to neural networks, but whose individual units compute either products or weighted sums), through a theoretical analysis that compares deep (multiple hidden layers) vs. shallow (one hidden layer) architectures. We prove there exist families of functions that can be represented much more efficiently with a deep network than with a shallow one, i.e. with substantially fewer hidden units. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to motivate recent research involving learning of deep sum-product networks, and more generally motivate research in Deep Learning."
2011,The Manifold Tangent Classifier.,"We combine three important ideas present in previous work for building classifiers: the semi-supervised hypothesis (the input distribution contains information about the classifier), the unsupervised manifold hypothesis (data density concentrates near low-dimensional manifolds), and the manifold hypothesis for classification (different classes correspond to disjoint manifolds separated by low density). We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classification results are obtained."
2011,On Tracking The Partition Function.,"Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have proven very powerful both as density estimators and feature extractors for classification. However, their use is often limited by an inability to estimate the partition function Z
. In this paper, we exploit the gradient descent training procedure of restricted Boltzmann machines (a type of MRF) to {\bf track} the log partition function during learning. Our method relies on two distinct sources of information: (1) estimating the change \Delta Z
incurred by each gradient update, (2) estimating the difference in Z
over a small set of tempered distributions using bridge sampling. The two sources of information are then combined using an inference procedure similar to Kalman filtering. Learning MRFs through Tempered Stochastic Maximum Likelihood, we can estimate Z
using no more temperatures than are required for learning. Comparing to both exact values and estimates using annealed importance sampling (AIS), we show on several datasets that our method is able to accurately track the log partition function. In contrast to AIS, our method provides this estimate at each time-step, at a computational cost similar to that required for training alone."
2011,Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization.,"Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [Larochelle et al., 2007] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements."
2011,Higher Order Contractive Auto-Encoder.,"Abstract
We propose a novel regularizer when training an auto-encoder for unsupervised feature extraction. We explicitly encourage the latent representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of the Jacobian (analytically) and the Hessian (stochastically) of the encoderâ€™s output with respect to its input, at the training points. While the penalty on the Jacobianâ€™s norm ensures robustness to tiny corruption of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hessian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample. From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with the auto-encoderâ€™s reconstruction objective yields a representation that varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus favors smooth manifold. We show that our proposed technique, while remaining computationally efficient, yields representations that are significantly better suited for initializing deep architectures than previously proposed approaches, beating state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets."
2011,"Discussion of ""The Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator"".","The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Smolensky, 1986; Hinton et al., 2006) has inspired much research in recent years, in particular as a building block for deep architectures (see Bengio (2009) for a review). The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an undirected graphical model with latent variables, exact inference, rather simple sampling procedures (block Gibbs), and several successful learning algorithms based on approximations of the log-likelihood gradient. However, when it comes to actually computing the distribution or density function, it is intractable, except when either the number of inputs or latent variables is very small (about 25 binary hidden units with current computers and about an hour of computing, on MNIST). "
2011,Deep Learners Benefit More from Out-of-Distribution Examples.,"Recent theoretical and empirical work in statistical machine learning has demonstrated the potential of learning algorithms for deep architectures, i.e., function classes obtained by composing multiple levels of representation. The hypothesis evaluated here is that intermediate levels of representation, because they can be shared across tasks and examples from different but related distributions, can yield even more benefits. Comparative experiments were performed on a large-scale handwritten character recognition setting with 62 classes (upper case, lower case, digits), using both a multi-task setting and perturbed examples in order to obtain out-ofdistribution examples. The results agree with the hypothesis, and show that a deep learner did beat previously published results and reached human-level performance. "
2011,A Spike and Slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine.,"We introduce the spike and slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine, characterized by having both a real-valued vector, the slab, and a binary variable, the spike, associated with each unit in the hidden layer. The model possesses some practical properties such as being amenable to Block Gibbs sampling as well as being capable of generating similar latent representations of the data to the recently introduced mean and covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We illustrate how the spike and slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine achieves competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 object recognition task."
2011,Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks.,"While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability "
2010,Decision trees do not generalize to new variations.,"The family of decision tree learning algorithms is among the most widespread and studied. Motivated by the desire to develop learning algorithms that can generalize when learning highly varying functions such as those presumably needed to achieve artificial intelligence, we study some theoretical limitations of decision trees. We demonstrate formally that they can be seriously hurt by the curse of dimensionality in a sense that is a bit different from other nonparametric statistical methods, but most importantly, that they cannot generalize to variations not seen in the training set. This is because a decision tree creates a partition of the input space and needs at least one example in each of the regions associated with a leaf to make a sensible prediction in that region. A better understanding of the fundamental reasons for this limitation suggests that one should use forests or even deeper architectures instead of trees, which provide a form of distributed representation and can generalize to variations not encountered in the training data.

2010,Alternative time representation in dopamine models.,"Dopaminergic neuron activity has been modeled during learning and appetitive behavior, most commonly using the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. However, a proper representation of elapsed time and of the exact task is usually required for the model to work. Most models use timing elements such as delay-line representations of time that are not biologically realistic for intervals in the range of seconds. The interval-timing literature provides several alternatives. One of them is that timing could emerge from general network dynamics, instead of coming from a dedicated circuit. Here, we present a general rate-based learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that learns a time representation when needed. Using a naïve network learning its environment in conjunction with TD, we reproduce dopamine activity in appetitive trace conditioning with a constant CS-US interval, including probe trials with unexpected delays. The proposed model learns a representation of the environment dynamics in an adaptive biologically plausible framework, without recourse to delay lines or other special-purpose circuits. Instead, the model predicts that the task-dependent representation of time is learned by experience, is encoded in ramp-like changes in single-neuron activity distributed across small neural networks, and reflects a temporal integration mechanism resulting from the inherent dynamics of recurrent loops within the network. The model also reproduces the known finding that trace conditioning is more difficult than delay conditioning and that the learned representation of the task can be highly dependent on the types of trials experienced during training. Finally, it suggests that the phasic dopaminergic signal could facilitate learning in the cortex.

2010,Why Does Unsupervised Pre-training Help Deep Learning?,"Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.

2010,Stacked Denoising Autoencoders: Learning Useful Representations in a Deep Network with a Local Denoising Criterion.,"We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.

2010,Deep Belief Networks Are Compact Universal Approximators.,"Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative models with many layers of hidden causal variables, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006), along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. Building on Le Roux and Bengio (2008) and Sutskever and Hinton (2008), we show that deep but narrow generative networks do not require more parameters than shallow ones to achieve universal approximation. Exploiting the proof technique, we prove that deep but narrow feedforward neural networks with sigmoidal units can represent any Boolean expression.

2010,Tractable Multivariate Binary Density Estimation and the Restricted Boltzmann Forest.,"We investigate the problem of estimating the density function of multivariate binary data. In particular, we focus on models for which computing the estimated probability of any data point is tractable. In such a setting, previous work has mostly concentrated on mixture modeling approaches. We argue that for the problem of tractable density estimation, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) provides a competitive framework for multivariate binary density modeling. With this in mind, we also generalize the RBM framework and present the restricted Boltzmann forest (RBForest), which replaces the binary variables in the hidden layer of RBMs with groups of tree-structured binary variables. This extension allows us to obtain models that have more modeling capacity but remain tractable. In experiments on several data sets, we demonstrate the competitiveness of this approach and study some of its properties.

2010,Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning.,"If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations."
2010,Learning Tags that Vary Within a Song.,"This paper examines the relationship between human generated tags describing different parts of the same song. These tags were collected using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service. We find that the agreement between different people’s tags decreases as the distance between the parts of a song that they heard increases. To model these tags and these relationships, we describe a conditional restricted Boltzmann machine. Using this model to fill in tags that should probably be present given a context of other tags, we train automatic tag classifiers (autotaggers) that outperform those trained on the original data."
2010,Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo for training of Restricted Boltzmann Machines.,"Alternating Gibbs sampling is the most common scheme used for sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), a crucial component in deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks. However, we find that it often does a very poor job of rendering the diversity of modes captured by the trained model. We suspect that this hinders the advantage that could in principle be brought by training algorithms relying on Gibbs sampling for uncovering spurious modes, such as the Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we explore the use of tempered Markov Chain Monte-Carlo for sampling in RBMs. We find both through visualization of samples and measures of likelihood on a toy dataset that it helps both sampling and learning."
2010,Why Does Unsupervised Pre-training Help Deep Learning?,"Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants with impressive results being obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language datasets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks often involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. The main question investigated here is the following: why does unsupervised pre-training work so well? Through extensive experimentation, we explore several possible explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009) and as an aid to optimization (Bengio et al. 2007). Our results build on the work of Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised training. However our results in an online setting, with a virtually unlimited data stream, point to a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of the roles of optimization and regularization in the unsupervised pre-training effect."
2010,Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks.,"Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence."
2009,Learning Deep Architectures for AI.,"Theoretical results strongly suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one needs deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks."
2009,Exploring Strategies for Training Deep Neural Networks.,"Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.

2009,Incorporating Functional Knowledge in Neural Networks.,"Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in its two arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of Lipschitz functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modelling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.
"
2009,Justifying and Generalizing Contrastive Divergence.,"We study an expansion of the log likelihood in undirected graphical models such as the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), where each term in the expansion is associated with a sample in a Gibbs chain alternating between two random variables (the visible vector and the hidden vector in RBMs). We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncation—running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the contrastive divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked autoassociators. The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs and requires only convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps k and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-k is a good descent direction even for small k.
"
2009,A Hybrid Pareto Mixture for Conditional Asymmetric Fat-Tailed Distributions.,"Abstract:
In many cases, we observe some variables X that contain predictive information over a scalar variable of interest Y, with (X, Y) pairs observed in a training set. We can take advantage of this information to estimate the conditional density p(Y|X=x). In this paper, we propose a conditional mixture model with hybrid Pareto components to estimate p(Y|X=x). The hybrid Pareto is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized Pareto tail. A third parameter, in addition to the location and spread parameters of the Gaussian, controls the heaviness of the upper tail. Using the hybrid Pareto in a mixture model results in a nonparametric estimator that can adapt to multimodality, asymmetry, and heavy tails. A conditional density estimator is built by modeling the parameters of the mixture estimator as functions of X. We use a neural network to implement these functions. Such conditional density estimators have important applications in many domains such as finance and insurance. We show experimentally that this novel approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood, compared to competing algorithms: conditional mixture models with other types of components and a classical kernel-based nonparametric model."

No abstract available."
2009,Curriculum learning.,"ABSTRACT
Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them ""curriculum learning"". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."
2009,Quadratic Features and Deep Architectures for Chunking.,"We experiment with several chunking models. Deeper architectures achieve better generalization. Quadratic filters, a simplification of a theoretical model of V1 complex cells, reliably increase accuracy. In fact, logistic regression with quadratic filters outperforms a standard single hidden layer neural network. Adding quadratic filters to logistic regression is almost as effective as feature engineering. Despite predicting each output label independently, our model is competitive with ones that use previous decisions."
2009,"Slow, Decorrelated Features for Pretraining Complex Cell-like Networks.","We introduce a new type of neural network activation function based on recent physiological rate models for complex cells in visual area V1. A single-hidden-layer neural network of this kind of model achieves 1.5% error on MNIST. We also introduce an existing criterion for learning slow, decorrelated features as a pretraining strategy for image models. This pretraining strategy results in orientation-selective features, similar to the receptive fields of complex cells. With this pretraining, the same single-hidden-layer model achieves better generalization error, even though the pretraining sample distribution is very different from the fine-tuning distribution. To implement this pretraining strategy, we derive a fast algorithm for online learning of decorrelated features such that each iteration of the algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of features."
2009,An Infinite Factor Model Hierarchy Via a Noisy-Or Mechanism.,"The Indian Buffet Process is a Bayesian nonparametric approach that models objects as arising from an infinite number of latent factors. Here we extend the latent factor model framework to two or more unbounded layers of latent factors. From a generative perspective, each layer defines a conditional \emph{factorial} prior distribution over the binary latent variables of the layer below via a noisy-or mechanism. We explore the properties of the model with two empirical studies, one digit recognition task and one music tag data experiment."
2009,The Difficulty of Training Deep Architectures and the Effect of Unsupervised Pre-Training.,"Whereas theoretical work suggests that deep architectures might be more efficient at representing highly-varying functions, training deep architectures was unsuccessful until the recent advent of algorithms based on unsupervised pretraining. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. Answering these questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization, the positive effect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a kind of regularizer. We show the influence of architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples."
2008,Representational Power of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks.,"Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs.

2008,Adaptive Importance Sampling to Accelerate Training of a Neural Probabilistic Language Model.,"Abstract:
Previous work on statistical language modeling has shown that it is possible to train a feedforward neural network to approximate probabilities over sequences of words, resulting in significant error reduction when compared to standard baseline models based on n-grams. However, training the neural network model with the maximum-likelihood criterion requires computations proportional to the number of words in the vocabulary. In this paper, we introduce adaptive importance sampling as a way to accelerate training of the model. The idea is to use an adaptive n-gram model to track the conditional distributions produced by the neural network. We show that a very significant speedup can be obtained on standard problems."
2008,Zero-data Learning of New Tasks.,"We introduce the problem of zero-data learning, where a model must generalize to classes or tasks for which no training data are available and only a description of the classes or tasks are provided. Zero-data learning is useful for problems where the set of classes to distinguish or tasks to solve is very large and is not entirely covered by the training data. The main contributions of this work lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in an experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and a multi-task ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how to extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero examples).

2008,Classification using discriminative restricted Boltzmann machines.,"ABSTRACT
Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting."
2008,Extracting and composing robust features with denoising autoencoders.,"ABSTRACT
Previous work has shown that the difficulties in learning deep generative or discriminative models can be overcome by an initial unsupervised learning step that maps inputs to useful intermediate representations. We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."
2007,Noisy K Best-Paths for Approximate Dynamic Programming with Application to Portfolio Optimization.,"We describe a general method to transform a non-Markovian sequential decision problem into a supervised learning problem using a K-best-paths algorithm. We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we can train a controller to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function. We illustrate the approach by demonstrating experimental results using a kernel-based controller architecture that would not normally be considered in traditional reinforcement learning or approximate dynamic programming. We further show that using a non-additive criterion (incremental Sharpe Ratio) yields a noisy K-best-paths extraction problem, that can give substantially improved performance."
2007,An empirical evaluation of deep architectures on problems with many factors of variation.,"ABSTRACT
Recently, several learning algorithms relying on models with deep architectures have been proposed. Though they have demonstrated impressive performance, to date, they have only been evaluated on relatively simple problems such as digit recognition in a controlled environment, for which many machine learning algorithms already report reasonable results. Here, we present a series of experiments which indicate that these models show promise in solving harder learning problems that exhibit many factors of variation. These models are compared with well-established algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks."
2007,Augmented Functional Time Series Representation and Forecasting with Gaussian Processes.,"We introduce a functional representation of time series which allows forecasts to be performed over an unspecified horizon with progressively-revealed information sets. By virtue of using Gaussian processes, a complete covariance matrix between forecasts at several time-steps is available. This information is put to use in an application to actively trade price spreads between commodity futures contracts. The approach delivers impressive out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns after transaction costs on a portfolio of 30 spreads. "
2007,Learning the 2-D Topology of Images.,"We study the following question: is the two-dimensional structure of images a very strong prior or is it something that can be learned with a few examples of natural images? If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a fixed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topology-extraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited."
2007,Topmoumoute Online Natural Gradient Algorithm.,"Guided by the goal of obtaining an optimization algorithm that is both fast and yielding good generalization, we study the descent direction maximizing the decrease in generalization error or the probability of not increasing generalization error. The surprising result is that from both the Bayesian and frequentist perspectives this can yield the natural gradient direction. Although that direction can be very expensive to compute we develop an efficient, general, online approximation to the natural gradient descent which is suited to large scale problems. We report experimental results showing much faster convergence in computation time and in number of iterations with TONGA (Topmoumoute Online natural Gradient Algorithm) than with stochastic gradient descent, even on very large datasets."
2007,A Hybrid Pareto Model for Conditional Density Estimation of Asymmetric Fat-Tail Data.,"We propose an estimator for the conditional density p(Y |X) that can adapt for asymmetric heavy tails which might depend on X. Such estimators have important applications in nance and insurance. We draw from Extreme Value Theory the tools to build a hybrid unimodal density having a parameter controlling the heaviness of the upper tail. This hybrid is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized Pareto tail. We use this hybrid in a multi-modal mixture in order to obtain a nonparametric density estimator that can easily adapt for heavy tailed data. To obtain a conditional density estimator, the parameters of the mixture estimator can be seen as functions of X and these functions learned. We show experimentally that this approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood than compared competing algorithms : conditional mixture models with other types of components and multivariate nonparametric models."
2007,Continuous Neural Networks.,"This article extends neural networks to the case of an uncountable number of hidden units, in several ways. In the first approach proposed, a finite parametrization is possible, allowing gradient-based learning. While having the same number of parameters as an ordinary neural network, its internal structure suggests that it can represent some smooth functions much more compactly. Under mild assumptions, we also find better error bounds than with ordinary neural networks. Furthermore, this parametrization may help reducing the problem of saturation of the neurons. In a second approach, the input-to-hidden weights are fully nonparametric, yielding a kernel machine for which we demonstrate a simple kernel formula. Interestingly, the resulting kernel machine can be made hyperparameter-free and still generalizes in spite of an absence of explicit regularization."
2006,Collaborative Filtering on a Family of Biological Targets.,"Building a QSAR model of a new biological target for which few screening data are available is a statistical challenge. However, the new target may be part of a bigger family, for which we have more screening data. Collaborative filtering or, more generally, multi-task learning, is a machine learning approach that improves the generalization performance of an algorithm by using information from related tasks as an inductive bias. We use collaborative filtering techniques for building predictive models that link multiple targets to multiple examples. The more commonalities between the targets, the better the multi-target model that can be built. We show an example of a multi-target neural network that can use family information to produce a predictive model of an undersampled target. We evaluate JRank, a kernel-based method designed for collaborative filtering. We show their performance on compound prioritization for an HTS campaign and the underlying shared representation between targets. JRank outperformed the neural network both in the single- and multi-target models.
"
2006,Nonlocal Estimation of Manifold Structure.,"We claim and present arguments to the effect that a large class of manifold learning algorithms that are essentially local and can be framed as kernel learning algorithms will suffer from the curse of dimensionality, at the dimension of the true underlying manifold. This observation invites an exploration of nonlocal manifold learning algorithms that attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A training criterion for such an algorithm is proposed, and experiments estimating a tangent plane prediction function are presented, showing its advantages with respect to local manifold learning algorithms: it is able to generalize very far from training data (on learning handwritten character image rotations), where local nonparametric methods fail.

2006,The K Best-Paths Approach to Approximate Dynamic Programming with Application to Portfolio Optimization.,"Abstract
We describe a general method to transform a non-markovian sequential decision problem into a supervised learning problem using a K-best-paths algorithm. We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we can train a controller to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function. We illustrate the approach by demonstrating experimental results using a kernel-based controller architecture that would not normally be considered in traditional reinforcement learning or approximate dynamic programming."
2006,Greedy Layer-Wise Training of Deep Networks.,"Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more ef cient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization. "
2005,Efficient Non-Parametric Function Induction in Semi-Supervised Learning.,"There has been an increase of interest for semi-supervised learning recently, because of the many datasets with large amounts of unlabeled examples and only a few labeled ones. This paper follows up on proposed non-parametric algorithms which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabelled examples. First, it extends them to function induction algorithms that minimize a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happen to have the form of Parzen windows regressors. This allows to predict test labels without solving again a linear system of dimension n, which can cost O(n^3). Second, this function induction procedure gives rise to an efficient approximation of the training process, reducing the linear system to be solved to m << n unknowns, using only a subset of m examples. An improvement of O(n^2/m^2) in time can thus be obtained. Comparative experiments are presented, showing the good performance of the induction formula and approximation algorithm."
2005,Hierarchical Probabilistic Neural Network Language Model.,"In recent years, variants of a neural network architecture for statistical language modeling have been proposed and successfully applied, e.g. in the language modeling component of speech recognizers. The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy. "
2005,Greedy Spectral Embedding.,"Spectral dimensionality reduction methods and spectral clustering methods require computation of the principal eigenvectors of an n × n matrix where n is the number of examples. Following up on previously proposed techniques to speed-up kernel methods by focusing on a subset of m examples, we study a greedy selection procedure for this subset, based on the featurespace distance between a candidate example and the span of the previously chosen ones. In the case of kernel PCA or spectral clustering this reduces computation to O(m 2 n). For the same computational complexity, we can also compute the feature space projection of the non-selected examples on the subspace spanned by the selected examples, to estimate the embedding function based on all the data, which yields considerably better estimation of the embedding function. This algorithm can be formulated in an online setting and we can bound the error on the approximation of the Gram matrix."
2005,Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization.,"We consider the semi-supervised learning problem, where a decision rule is to be learned from labeled and unlabeled data. In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution benefits from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the ""cluster assumption"". Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces."
2005,The Curse of Highly Variable Functions for Local Kernel Machines.,"We present a series of theoretical arguments supporting the claim that a large class of modern learning algorithms that rely solely on the smoothness prior - with similarity between examples expressed with a local kernel - are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, or more precisely to the variability of the target. Our discussion covers supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very specific prior domain knowledge."
2005,Non-Local Manifold Parzen Windows.,"To escape from the curse of dimensionality, we claim that one can learn non-local functions, in the sense that the value and shape of the learned function at x must be inferred using examples that may be far from x. With this objective, we present a non-local non-parametric density estimator. It builds upon previously proposed Gaussian mixture models with regularized covariance matrices to take into account the local shape of the manifold. It also builds upon recent work on non-local estimators of the tangent plane of a manifold, which are able to generalize in places with little training data, unlike traditional, local, non-parametric models."
2005,Convex Neural Networks.,"Convexity has recently received a lot of attention in the machine learning community, and the lack of convexity has been seen as a major disadvantage of many learning algorithms, such as multi-layer artificial neural networks. We show that training multi-layer neural networks in which the number of hidden units is learned can be viewed as a convex optimization problem. This problem involves an infinite number of variables, but can be solved by incrementally inserting a hidden unit at a time, each time finding a linear classifier that minimizes a weighted sum of errors.

2004,Locally Linear Embedding for dimensionality reduction in QSAR.,"Abstract
Current practice in Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods usually involves generating a great number of chemical descriptors and then cutting them back with variable selection techniques. Variable selection is an effective method to reduce the dimensionality but may discard some valuable information. This paper introduces Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), a local non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, that can statistically discover a low-dimensional representation of the chemical data. LLE is shown to create more stable representations than other non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms, and to be capable of capturing non-linearity in chemical data."
2004,No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of K-Fold Cross-Validation.,"Most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare the performance of different algorithms (in particular, their proposed algorithm). In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied."
2004,Learning Eigenfunctions Links Spectral Embedding and Kernel PCA.,"In this letter, we show a direct relation between spectral embedding methods and kernel principal components analysis and how both are special cases of a more general learning problem: learning the principal eigenfunctions of an operator defined from a kernel and the unknown data-generating density. Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."
2004,Unsupervised Sense Disambiguation Using Bilingual Probabilistic Models.,"We describe two probabilistic models for unsupervised word-sense disambiguation using parallel corpora. The first model, which we call the Sense model, builds on the work of Diab and Resnik (2002) that uses both parallel text and a sense inventory for the target language, and recasts their approach in a probabilistic framework. The second model, which we call the Concept model, is a hierarchical model that uses a concept latent variable to relate different language specific sense labels. We show that both models improve performance on the word sense disambiguation task over previous unsupervised approaches, with the Concept model showing the largest improvement. Furthermore, in learning the Concept model, as a by-product, we learn a sense inventory for the parallel language."
2004,Non-Local Manifold Tangent Learning.,"We claim and present arguments to the effect that a large class of manifold learning algorithms that are essentially local and can be framed as kernel learning algorithms will suffer from the curse of dimensionality, at the dimension of the true underlying manifold. This observation suggests to explore non-local manifold learning algorithms which attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A criterion for such an algorithm is proposed and experiments estimating a tangent plane prediction function are presented, showing its advantages with respect to local manifold learning algorithms: it is able to generalize very far from training data (on learning handwritten character image rotations), where a local non-parametric method fails."
2004,Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization.,"We consider the semi-supervised learning problem, where a decision rule is to be learned from labeled and unlabeled data. In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution benefits from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the ""cluster assumption"". Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces."
2004,Brain Inspired Reinforcement Learning.,"Successful application of reinforcement learning algorithms often involves considerable hand-crafting of the necessary non-linear features to reduce the complexity of the value functions and hence to promote convergence of the algorithm. In contrast, the human brain readily and autonomously finds the complex features when provided with sufficient training. Recent work in machine learning and neurophysiology has demonstrated the role of the basal ganglia and the frontal cortex in mammalian reinforcement learning. This paper develops and explores new reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by neurological evidence that provides potential new approaches to the feature construction problem. The algorithms are compared and evaluated on the Acrobot task."
2003,Scaling Large Learning Problems with Hard Parallel Mixtures.,"A challenge for statistical learning is to deal with large data sets, e.g. in data mining. The training time of ordinary Support Vector Machines is at least quadratic, which raises a serious research challenge if we want to deal with data sets of millions of examples. We propose a ""hard parallelizable mixture"" methodology which yields significantly reduced training time through modularization and parallelization: the training data is iteratively partitioned by a ""gater"" model in such a way that it becomes easy to learn an ""expert"" model separately in each region of the partition. A probabilistic extension and the use of a set of generative models allows representing the gater so that all pieces of the model are locally trained. For SVMs, time complexity appears empirically to local growth linearly with the number of examples, while generalization performance can be enhanced. For the probabilistic version of the algorithm, the iterative algorithm probably goes down in a cost function that is an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood.
"
2003,A Neural Probabilistic Language Model.,"A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.s"
2003,Extensions to Metric-Based Model Selection.,"Metric-based methods have recently been introduced for model selection and regularization, often yielding very significant improvements over the alternatives tried (including cross-validation). All these methods require unlabeled data over which to compare functions and detect gross differences in behavior away from the training points. We introduce three new extensions of the metric model selection methods and apply them to feature selection. The first extension takes advantage of the particular case of time-series data in which the task involves prediction with a horizon h. The idea is to use at t the h unlabeled examples that precede t for model selection. The second extension takes advantage of the different error distributions of cross-validation and the metric methods: cross-validation tends to have a larger variance and is unbiased. A hybrid combining the two model selection methods is rarely beaten by any of the two methods. The third extension deals with the case when unlabeled data is not available at all, using an estimated input density. Experiments are described to study these extensions in the context of capacity control and feature subset selection."
2003,Inference for the Generalization Error.,"In order to compare learning algorithms, experimental results reported in the machine learning literature often use statistical tests of significance to support the claim that a new learning algorithm generalizes better. Such tests should take into account the variability due to the choice of training set and not only that due to the test examples, as is often the case. This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a variant of the cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased. This analysis allows us to propose new estimators of this variance. We show, via simulations, that tests of hypothesis about the generalization error using those new variance estimators have better properties than tests involving variance estimators currently in use and listed in Dietterich (1998). In particular, the new tests have correct size and good power. That is, the new tests do not reject the null hypothesis too often when the hypothesis is true, but they tend to frequently reject the null hypothesis when the latter is false."
2003,"Bias learning, knowledge sharing.","Abstract:
Biasing properly the hypothesis space of a learner has been shown to improve generalization performance. Methods for achieving this goal have been proposed, that range from designing and introducing a bias into a learner to automatically learning the bias. Multitask learning methods fall into the latter category. When several related tasks derived from the same domain are available, these methods use the domain-related knowledge coded in the training examples of all the tasks as a source of bias. We extend some of the ideas presented in this field and describe a new approach that identifies a family of hypotheses, represented by a manifold in hypothesis space, that embodies domain-related knowledge. This family is learned using training examples sampled from a group of related tasks. Learning models trained on these tasks are only allowed to select hypotheses that belong to the family. We show that the new approach encompasses a large variety of families which can be learned. A statistical analysis on a class of related tasks is performed that shows significantly improved performances when using this approach."
2003,Quick Training of Probabilistic Neural Nets by Importance Sampling.,"The device of this invention uses electrostatic recording to apply original titles, legends, or other indicia to discrete record receivers. The system includes changeable stencils which, for the purposes of this description, are constructed as counters. The desired information is set up, a voltage is applied between the stencil and an electrode behind a record receiver, ionized pigmented particles are attracted through the stencils to the record receiver, and the record receiver is moved to a fixing station. By rendering the individual items of information changeable, any desired information within the range of the apparatus can be applied to an appropriate record receiver."
2003,"Out-of-Sample Extensions for LLE, Isomap, MDS, Eigenmaps, and Spectral Clustering.","Several unsupervised learning algorithms based on an eigendecomposition provide either an embedding or a clustering only for given training points, with no straightforward extension for out-of-sample examples short of recomputing eigenvectors. This paper provides a unified framework for extending Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (for dimensionality reduction) as well as for Spectral Clustering. This framework is based on seeing these algorithms as learning eigenfunctions of a data-dependent kernel. Numerical experiments show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms due to the choice of training data."

2002,Model Selection for Small Sample Regression.,"Model selection is an important ingredient of many machine learning algorithms, in particular when the sample size in small, in order to strike the right trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. Previous classical results for linear regression are based on an asymptotic analysis. We present a new penalization method for performing model selection for regression that is appropriate even for small samples. Our penalization is based on an accurate estimator of the ratio of the expected training error and the expected generalization error, in terms of the expected eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix."
2002,Kernel Matching Pursuit.,"Abstract
Matching Pursuit algorithms learn a function that is a weighted sum of basis functions, by sequentially appending functions to an initially empty basis, to approximate a target function in the least-squares sense. We show how matching pursuit can be extended to use non-squared error loss functions, and how it can be used to build kernel-based solutions to machine learning problems, while keeping control of the sparsity of the solution. We present a version of the algorithm that makes an optimal choice of both the next basis and the weights of all the previously chosen bases. Finally, links to boosting algorithms and RBF training procedures, as well as an extensive experimental comparison with SVMs for classification are given, showing comparable results with typically much sparser models."
2002,A Parallel Mixture of SVMs for Very Large Scale Problems.,"Support vector machines (SVMs) are the state-of-the-art models for many classification problems, but they suffer from the complexity of their training algorithm, which is at least quadratic with respect to the number of examples. Hence, it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundred thousand examples with SVMs. This article proposes a new mixture of SVMs that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each SVM is trained on a small subset of the whole data set. Experiments on a large benchmark data set (Forest) yielded significant time improvement (time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples). In addition, and surprisingly, a significant improvement in generalization was observed.
"
2002,Robust Regression with Asymmetric Heavy-Tail Noise Distributions.,"In the presence of a heavy-tail noise distribution, regression becomes much more difficult. Traditional robust regression methods assume that the noise distribution is symmetric, and they downweight the influence of so-called outliers. When the noise distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased regression estimators. Motivated by data-mining problems for the insurance industry, we propose a new approach to robust regression tailored to deal with asymmetric noise distribution. The main idea is to learn most of the parameters of the model using conditional quantile estimators (which are biased but robust estimators of the regression) and to learn a few remaining parameters to combine and correct these estimators, to minimize the average squared error in an unbiased way. Theoretical analysis and experiments show the clear advantages of the approach. Results are on artificial data as well as insurance data, using both linear and neural network predictors.

2002,Manifold Parzen Windows.,"The similarity between objects is a fundamental element of many learning algorithms. Most non-parametric methods take this similarity to be fixed, but much recent work has shown the advantages of learning it, in particular to exploit the local invariances in the data or to capture the possibly non-linear manifold on which most of the data lies. We propose a new non-parametric kernel density estimation method which captures the local structure of an underlying manifold through the leading eigenvectors of regularized local covariance matrices. Experiments in density estimation show significant improvements with respect to Parzen density estimators. The density estimators can also be used within Bayes classifiers, yielding classification rates similar to SVMs and much superior to the Parzen classifier."

2001,Experiments on the application of IOHMMs to model financial returns series.,"Abstract:
Input-output hidden Markov models (IOHMM) are conditional hidden Markov models in which the emission (and possibly the transition) probabilities can be conditioned on an input sequence. For example, these conditional distributions can be linear, logistic, or nonlinear (using for example multilayer neural networks). We compare the generalization performance of several models which are special cases of input-output hidden Markov models on financial time-series prediction tasks: an unconditional Gaussian, a conditional linear Gaussian, a mixture of Gaussians, a mixture of conditional linear Gaussians, a hidden Markov model, and various IOHMMs. The experiments compare these models on predicting the conditional density of returns of market and sector indices. Note that the unconditional Gaussian estimates the first moment with the historical average. The results show that, although for the first moment the historical average gives the best results, for the higher moments, the IOHMMs yielded significantly better performance, as estimated by the out-of-sample likelihood."
2001,Cost functions and model combination for VaR-based asset allocation using neural networks.,"Abstract:
We introduce an asset-allocation framework based on the active control of the value-at-risk of the portfolio. Within this framework, we compare two paradigms for making the allocation using neural networks. The first one uses the network to make a forecast of asset behavior, in conjunction with a traditional mean-variance allocator for constructing the portfolio. The second paradigm uses the network to directly make the portfolio allocation decisions. We consider a method for performing soft input variable selection, and show its considerable utility. We use model combination (committee) methods to systematize the choice of hyperparameters during training. We show that committees using both paradigms are significantly outperforming the benchmark market performance."

2001,K-Local Hyperplane and Convex Distance Nearest Neighbor Algorithms.,"Guided by an initial idea of building a complex (non linear) decision surface with maximal local margin in input space, we give a possible geometrical intuition as to why K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms often perform more poorly than SVMs on classification tasks. We then propose modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to overcome the perceived problem. The approachis similar in spirit to Tangent Distance, but with invariances inferred from the local neighborhood rather than prior knowledge. Experimental results on real world classification tasks suggest that the modified KNN algorithms often give a dramatic improvement over standard KNN and perform as well or better than SVMs."
2001,Estimating Car Insurance Premia: a Case Study in High-Dimensional Data Inference.,"Estimating insurance premia from data is a difficult regression problem for several reasons: the large number of variables, many of which are discrete, and the very peculiar shape of the noise distribution, asymmetric with fat tails, with a large majority zeros and a few unreliable and very large values. We compare several machine learning methods for estimating insurance premia, and test them on a large data base of car insurance policies. We find that function approximation methods that do not optimize a squared loss, like Support Vector Machines regression, do not work well in this context. Compared methods include decision trees and generalized linear models. The best results are obtained with a mixture of experts, which better identifies the least and most risky contracts, and allows to reduce the median premium by charging more to the most risky customers."
2001,Topic Segmentation : A First Stage to Dialog-Based Information Extraction.,We study the problem of topic segmentation of manually transcribed speech in order to facilitate information extraction from dialogs. Our approach is based on a combination of multi-source knowledge modeled by hidden Markov models. We experiment with different combinations of linguistic-level cues on dialogs dealing with search and rescue missions. Results show the effectiveness of multi-source knowledge. 
2000,Boosting Neural Networks.,"Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of learning algorithms. A recently proposed boosting algorithm, Ada Boost, has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using mainly decision trees as base classifiers. In this article we investigate whether Ada Boost also works as well with neural networks, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different versions of the Ada Boost algorithm. In particular, we compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. The results suggest that random resampling of the training data is not the main explanation of the success of the improvements brought by Ada Boost. This is in contrast to bagging, which directly aims at reducing variance and for which random resampling is essential to obtain the reduction in generalization error. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data set of on-line handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. A boosted multilayer network achieved 1.5% error on the UCI letters and 8.1% error on the UCI satellite data set, which is significantly better than boosted decision trees.

2000,Gradient-Based Optimization of Hyperparameters.,"Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated as the minimization of a training criterion that involves a hyperparameter. This hyperparameter is usually chosen by trial and error with a model selection criterion. In this article we present a methodology to optimize several hyper-parameters, based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters. In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters is efficiently computed by backpropagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion.

2000,Taking on the curse of dimensionality in joint distributions using neural networks.,"Abstract:
The curse of dimensionality is severe when modeling high-dimensional discrete data: the number of possible combinations of the variables explodes exponentially. We propose an architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow at most as the square of the number of variables, using a multilayer neural network to represent the joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables (thus reducing significantly the number of parameters). Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network."

Biasing the hypothesis space of a learner has been shown to improve generalisation performances. Methods for achieving this goal are proposed, that range from deriving and introducing a bias into a learner to automatically learning the bias. In the latter case, most methods learn the bias by simultaneously training several related tasks derived from the same domain and imposing constraints on their parameters. We extend some of the ideas presented in this field and describe a new model that parametrizes the parameters of each task as a function of an affine manifold defined in parameter space and a point lying on the manifold. An analysis of variance on a class of learning tasks is performed that shows some significantly improved performances when using the model."

Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be incorporated into probabilistic models. In this paper we review some of the approaches which have been proposed to incorporate them into probabilistic models of sequential data, such as hidden Markov models (HMM). We also discuss new developments and new ideas in this area, in particular how ANN can be used to model high-dimensional discrete and continuous data to deal with the curse of dimensionality and how the ideas proposed in these models could be applied to statistical language modeling to represent longer-term context than allowed by trigram models, while keeping word-order information."
2000,A Neural Support Vector Network Architecture with Adaptive Kernels.,"Abstract:
In the Support Vector Machines (SVM) framework, the positive-definite kernel can be seen as representing a fixed similarity measure between two patterns, and a discriminant function is obtained by taking a linear combination of the kernels computed at training examples called support vectors. We investigate learning architectures in which the kernel functions can be replaced by more general similarity measures that can have arbitrary internal parameters. The training criterion used in SVMs is not appropriate for this purpose so we adopt the simple criterion that is generally used when training neural networks for classification tasks. Several experiments are performed which show that such Neural Support Vector Networks perform similarly to SVMs while requiring significantly fewer support vectors, even when the similarity measure has no internal parameters."

2000,Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing.,"Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints. "

Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."
1999,Stochastic Learning of Strategic Equilibria for Auctions.,This article presents a new application of stochastic adaptive learning algorithms to the computation of strategic equilibria in auctions. The proposed approach addresses the problems of tracking a moving target and balancing exploration (of action space) versus exploitation (of better modeled regions of action space). Neural networks are used to represent a stochastic decision model for each bidder. Experiments confirm the correctness and usefulness of the approach. 
1999,Binary Pseudowavelets and Applications to Bilevel Image Processing.,"Abstract:
This paper shows the existence of binary pseudowavelets, bases on the binary domain that exhibit some of the properties of wavelets, such as multiresolution reconstruction and compact support. The binary pseudowavelets are defined on B/sup n/ (binary vectors of length n) and are operated upon with the binary operators logical and, and exclusive or. The forward transform, or analysis, is the decomposition of a binary vector into its constituent binary pseudowavelets. Binary pseudowavelets allow multiresolution, progressive reconstruction of binary vectors by using progressively more coefficients in the inverse transform. Binary pseudowavelets bases, being sparse matrices, also provide for fast transforms; moreover pseudowavelets rely on hardware-friendly operations for efficient software and hardware implementation."

1999,Object Recognition with Gradient-Based Learning.,"Abstract
Finding an appropriate set of features is an essential problem in the design of shape recognition systems. This paper attempts to show that for recognizing simple objects with high shape variability such as handwritten characters, it is possible, and even advantageous, to feed the system directly with minimally processed images and to rely on learning to extract the right set of features. Convolutional Neural Networks are shown to be particularly well suited to this task. We also show that these networks can be used to recognize multiple objects without requiring explicit segmentation of the objects from their surrounding. The second part of the paper presents the Graph Transformer Network model which extends the applicability of gradient-based learning to systems that use graphs to represents features, objects, and their combinations."
1998,Gaussian Mixture Densities for Classification of Nuclear Power Plant Data.,"In this paper we are concerned with the application of learning algorithms to the classification of reactor states in nuclear plants. Two aspects must be considered: (1) some types events (e.g., abnormal or rare) will not appear in the data set, but the system should be able to detect them, (2) not only classification of signals but also their interpretation are important for nuclear plant monitoring. We address both issues with a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians in which some parameters are shared to reflect the similar signals observed in different states of the reactor. An EM algorithm for these shared Gaussian mixtures is presented.  Experimental results on nuclear plant data demonstrate  the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the above two points."
1998,"High quality document image compression with ""DjVu"".","We present a new image compression technique called ""DjVu"" that is specifically geared towards the compression of highresolution, high-quality images of scanned documents in color. This enables fast transmission of document images over low-speed connections, while faithfully reproducing the visual aspect of the document, including color, fonts, pictures, and paper texture. The DjVu compressor separates the text and drawings, which need a high spatial resolution, from the pictures and backgrounds, which are smoother and can be coded at a lower spatial resolution. Then, several novel techniques are used to maximize the compression ratio: the bi-level foreground image is encoded with AT&T’s proposal to the new JBIG2 fax standard, and a new wavelet-based compression method is used for the backgrounds and pictures. Both techniques use a new adaptive binary arithmetic coder called the ZP-coder. A typical magazine page in color at 300 dpi (dots per inch) can be compressed down to between 40 and 60 kbytes, approximately 5–10 times better than JPEG for a similar level of subjective quality. A real-time, memory efficient version of the decoder was implemented, and is available as a plug-in for popular web browsers."
1998,Browsing through High Quality Document Images with DjVu.,"Abstract:
Presents a new image compression technique called ""DjVu"" that is specifically geared towards the compression of high-resolution, high-quality images of scanned documents in color. With DjVu, any screen connected to the Internet can access and display images of scanned pages while faithfully reproducing the font, color, drawings, pictures and paper texture. A typical magazine page in color at 300 dpi can be compressed down to between 40 to 60 KBytes, approximately 5 to 10 times better than JPEG for a similar level of subjective quality. Black-and-white documents are typically 15 to 30 KBytes at 300 dpi, or 4 to 8 times better than CCITT-G4. A real-time, memory-efficient version of the decoder was implemented, and is available as a plug-in for popular Web browsers."
1998,The Z-Coder Adaptive Binary Coder.,"Abstract:
We present the Z-coder, a new adaptive data compression coder for coding binary data. The Z-coder is derived from the Golomb (1966) run-length coder, and retains most of the speed and simplicity of the earlier coder. The Z-coder can also be thought of as a multiplication-free approximate arithmetic coder, showing the close relationship between run-length coding and arithmetic coding. The Z-coder improves upon existing arithmetic coders by its speed and its principled design. We present a derivation of the Z-coder as well as details of the construction of its adaptive probability estimation table."
1998,A Memory-Efficient Adaptive Huffman Coding Algorthm for Very Large Sets of Symbols.,"Abstract:
Summary form only given. The problem of computing the minimum redundancy codes as we observe symbols one by one has received a lot of attention. However, existing algorithms implicitly assumes that either we have a small alphabet or that we have an arbitrary amount of memory at our disposal for the creation of a coding tree. In real life applications one may need to encode symbols coming from a much larger alphabet, for e.g. coding integers. We introduce a new algorithm for adaptive Huffman coding, called algorithm M, that uses space proportional to the number of frequency classes. The algorithm uses a tree with leaves that represent sets of symbols with the same frequency, rather than individual symbols. The code for each symbol is therefore composed of a prefix (specifying the set, or the leaf of the tree) and a suffix (specifying the symbol within the set of same-frequency symbols). The algorithm uses only two operations to remain as close as possible to the optimal: set migration and rebalancing. We analyze the computational complexity of algorithm M, and point to its advantages in terms of low memory complexity and fast decoding. Comparative experiments were performed with algorithm M on the Calgary corpus, with static Huffman coding as well as with another adaptive Huffman coding algorithms, algorithm /spl Lambda/ of Vitter. Experiments show that M performs comparably or better than the other algorithms but requires much less memory. Finally, we present an improved algorithm, M/sup +/, for non-stationary data, which models the distribution of the data in a fixed-size window in the data sequence."
1998,Support vector machines for improving the classification of brain PET images.,"The classification of brain PET volumes is carried out in three main steps: (1) registration, (2) feature extraction and (3) classification. The PET images were already smoothed with a 16 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel and registered within the Talairach and Tournoux reference system. To make the registration more accurate over a single reference, a method based on optical flow was applied. Feature extraction is carried out by principal component analysis (PCA). Support vector machines (SVM) are then used for classification, because they are better controlled than neural networks (NN) and well adapted to small sample size problems. SVM are constructed by a training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training vectors and the decision boundary. The algorithm is simple quadratic programming under linear constraints, which leads to global optimum. The decision boundary is expressed as a linear combination of supporting vectors which are a subset of the training vectors closest to the decision boundary. After registration, NN and SVM were trained with the features extracted by PCA from the training set. The estimate error rate is 7.1% for SVM and 14.3% for NN."
1997,Using a Financial Training Criterion Rather than a Prediction Criterion.,"The application of this work is to decision making with financial time series, using learning algorithms. The traditional approach is to train a model using a prediction criterion, such as minimizing the squared error between predictions and actual values of a dependent variable, or maximizing the likelihood of a conditional model of the dependent variable. We find here with noisy time series that better results can be obtained when the model is directly trained in order to maximize the financial criterion of interest, here gains and losses (including those due to transactions) incurred during trading. Experiments were performed on portfolio selection with 35 Canadian stocks.

1997,Global Training of Document Processing Systems Using Graph Transformer Networks.,"Abstract:
We propose a new machine learning paradigm called Graph Transformer Networks that extends the applicability of gradient-based learning algorithms to systems composed of modules that take graphs as inputs and produce graphs as output. Training is performed by computing gradients of a global objective function with respect to all the parameters in the system using a kind of back-propagation procedure. A complete check reading system based on these concepts is described. The system uses convolutional neural network character recognizers, combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is presently deployed commercially and reads million of checks per month."
1997,AdaBoosting Neural Networks: Application to on-line Character Recognition.,"Abstract
â€œBoostingâ€ is a general method for improving the performance of any weak learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [4]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [3], in particular decision trees [1,2,5]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of a strong learning algorithm: a neural network based on-line character recognition system. In particular we will show that it can be used to learn automatically a great variety of writing styles even when the amount of training data for each style varies a lot. Our system achieves about 1.4 % error on a handwritten digit data base of more than 200 writers."
1997,Reading checks with multilayer graph transformer networks.,"Abstract:
We propose a new machine learning paradigm called multilayer graph transformer network that extends the applicability of gradient-based learning algorithms to systems composed of modules that take graphs as input and produce graphs as output. A complete check reading system based on this concept is described. The system combines convolutional neural network character recognizers with graph-based stochastic models trained cooperatively at the document level. It is deployed commercially and reads million of business and personal checks per month with record accuracy."
1997,Discriminative feature and model design for automatic speech recognition.,"A system for discriminative feature and model design is presented for automatic speech recognition. Training based on minimum classification error using a single objective function is applied for designing a set of parallel networks performing feature transformation and a set of hidden Markov models performing speech recognition. This paper compares the use of linear and non-linear functional transformations when applied to conventional recognition features, such as spectrum or cepstrum. It also provides a framework for integrated feature and model training when using class-specific transformations. Experimental results on telephone-based connected digit recognition are presented.
"
1997,Shared Context Probabilistic Transducers.,"Recently, a model for supervised learning of probabilistic transducers represented by suffix trees was introduced. However, this algorithm tends to build very large trees, requiring very large amounts of computer memory. In this paper, we propose a new, more compact, transducer model in which one shares the parameters of distributions associated to contexts yielding similar conditional output distributions. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm with comparative experiments on inducing a noun phrase recognizer."
1997,Training Methods for Adaptive Boosting of Neural Networks.,"""Boosting"" is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], and decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 1.5% error on the UCI Letters and 8.1 % error on the UCI satellite data set."
1996,Input-output HMMs for sequence processing.,"Abstract:
We consider problems of sequence processing and propose a solution based on a discrete-state model in order to represent past context. We introduce a recurrent connectionist architecture having a modular structure that associates a subnetwork to each state. The model has a statistical interpretation we call input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM). It can be trained by the estimation-maximization (EM) or generalized EM (GEM) algorithms, considering state trajectories as missing data, which decouples temporal credit assignment and actual parameter estimation. The model presents similarities to hidden Markov models (HMMs), but allows us to map input sequences to output sequences, using the same processing style as recurrent neural networks. IOHMMs are trained using a more discriminant learning paradigm than HMMs, while potentially taking advantage of the EM algorithm. We demonstrate that IOHMMs are well suited for solving grammatical inference problems on a benchmark problem. Experimental results are presented for the seven Tomita grammars, showing that these adaptive models can attain excellent generalization."
1996,Multi-Task Learning for Stock Selection.,"Artificial Neural Networks can be used to predict future returns of stocks in order to take financial decisions. Should one build a separate network for each stock or share the same network for all the stocks? In this paper we also explore other alternatives, in which some layers are shared and others are not shared. When the prediction of future returns for different stocks are viewed as different tasks, sharing some parameters across stocks is a form of multi-task learning. In a series of experiments with Canadian stocks, we obtain yearly returns that are more than 14% above various benchmarks."
1995,Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models.,"This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm."
1995,LeRec: a NN/HMM hybrid for on-line handwriting recognition.,"We introduce a new approach for on-line recognition of handwritten words written in unconstrained mixed style. The preprocessor performs a word-level normalization by fitting a model of the word structure using the EM algorithm. Words are then coded into low resolution ""annotated images"" where each pixel contains information about trajectory direction and curvature. The recognizer is a convolution network that can be spatially replicated. From the network output, a hidden Markov model produces word scores. The entire system is globally trained to minimize word-level errors.

1995,On the search for new learning rules for ANNs.,"Abstract
In this paper, we present a framework where a learning rule can be optimized within a parametric learning rule space. We define what we callparametric learning rules and present a theoretical study of theirgeneralization properties when estimated from a set of learning tasks and tested over another set of tasks. We corroborate the results of this study with practical experiments."
1995,Recurrent Neural Networks for Missing or Asynchronous Data.,"In this paper we propose recurrent neural networks with feedback into the input units for handling two types of data analysis problems. On the one hand, this scheme can be used for static data when some of the input variables are missing. On the other hand, it can also be used for sequential data, when some of the input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies. Unlike in the case of probabilistic models (e.g. Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network does not attempt to model the distribution of the missing variables given the observed variables. Instead it is a more ""discriminant"" approach that fills in the missing variables for the sole purpose of minimizing a learning criterion (e.g., to minimize an output error). "
1995,Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks for Long-Term Dependencies.,"We have already shown that extracting long-term dependencies from sequential data is di cult, both for deterministic dynamical systems such as recurrent networks, and probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) or input/output hidden Markov models (IOHMMs). In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain speci c a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments con rm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs."
1994,Learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult.,"Abstract:
Recurrent neural networks can be used to map input sequences to output sequences, such as for recognition, production or prediction problems. However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.< >"
1994,Use of Genetic Programming for the Search of a New Learning Rule for Neural Networks.,"Abstract:
In previous work we explained how to use standard optimization methods such as simulated annealing, gradient descent and genetic algorithms to optimize a parametric function which could be used as a learning rule for neural networks. To use these methods, we had to choose a fixed number of parameters and a rigid form for the learning rule. In this article, we propose to use genetic programming to find not only the values of rule parameters but also the optimal number of parameters and the form of the rule. Experiments on classification tasks suggest genetic programming finds better learning rules than other optimization methods. Furthermore, the best rule found with genetic programming outperformed the well-known backpropagation algorithm for a given set of tasks.< >"
1994,Word-level training of a handwritten word recognizer based on convolutional neural networks.,"Abstract:

1994,An EM approach to grammatical inference: input/output HMMs.,"Abstract:
Proposes a modular recurrent connectionist architecture for adaptive temporal processing. The model is given, a probabilistic interpretation and is trained using the estimation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. This model can also be seen as an input/output hidden Markov model. The focus of this paper is on sequence classification tasks. The authors demonstrate that EM supervised learning is well suited for solving grammatical inference problems. Experimental benchmark results are presented for the seven Tomita grammars, showing that these adaptive models can, attain excellent generalization."
1994,Word normalization for online handwritten word recognition.,"Abstract:
We introduce a new approach to normalizing words written with an electronic stylus that applies to all styles of handwriting (upper case, lower case, printed, cursive, or mixed). A geometrical model of the word spatial structure is fitted to the pen trajectory using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. The fitting process maximizes the likelihood of the trajectory given the model and a set a priors on its parameters. The method was evaluated and integrated to a recognition system that combines neural networks and hidden Markov models."
1994,An Input Output HMM Architecture.,"We introduce a recurrent architecture having a modular structure and we formulate a training procedure based on the EM algorithm. The resulting model has similarities to hidden Markov models, but supports recurrent networks processing style and allows to exploit the supervised learning paradigm while using maximum likelihood estimation. s"
1994,Diffusion of Credit in Markovian Models.,"This paper studies the problem of diffusion in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and how it makes very difficult the task of learning of long-term dependencies in sequences. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that the problem of diffusion is reduced if the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1. Under this condition, standard HMMs have very limited modeling capabilities, but input/output HMMs can still perform interesting computations. "
1994,Convergence Properties of the K-Means Algorithms.,This paper studies the convergence properties of the well known K-Means clustering algorithm. The K-Means algorithm can be described either as a gradient descent algorithm or by slightly extending the mathematics of the EM algorithm to this hard threshold case. We show that the K-Means algorithm actually minimizes the quantization error using the very fast Newton algorithm. 
1993,A Connectionist Approach to Speech Recognition.,"The task discussed in this paper is that of learning to map input sequences to output sequences. In particular, problems of phoneme recognition in continuous speech are considered, but most of the discussed techniques could be applied to other tasks, such as the recognition of sequences of handwritten characters. The systems considered in this paper are based on connectionist models, or artificial neural networks, sometimes combined with statistical techniques for recognition of sequences of patterns, stressing the integration of prior knowledge and learning. Different architectures for sequence and speech recognition are reviewed, including recurrent networks as well as hybrid systems involving hidden Markov models.
"
1993,The problem of learning long-term dependencies in recurrent networks.,"Abstract:
The authors seek to train recurrent neural networks in order to map input sequences to output sequences, for applications in sequence recognition or production. Results are presented showing that learning long-term dependencies in such recurrent networks using gradient descent is a very difficult task. It is shown how this difficulty arises when robustly latching bits of information with certain attractors. The derivatives of the output at time t with respect to the unit activations at time zero tend rapidly to zero as t increases for most input values. In such a situation, simple gradient descent techniques appear inappropriate. The consideration of alternative optimization methods and architectures is suggested.< >"
1993,Credit Assignment through Time: Alternatives to Backpropagation.,"Learning to recognize or predict sequences using long-term context has many applications. However, practical and theoretical problems are found in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which input/output dependencies span long intervals. Starting from a mathematical analysis of the problem, we consider and compare alternative algorithms and architectures on tasks for which the span of the input/output dependencies can be controlled. Results on the new algorithms show performance qualitatively superior to that obtained with backpropagation."

1992,Learning the dynamic nature of speech with back-propagation for sequences.,"Abstract
A novel learning algorithm is proposed, called Back-Propagation for Sequences (BPS), for a particular class of dynamic neural networks in which some units have local feedback. These networks can be trained to respond to sequences of input patterns and seem particularly suited for phoneme recognition. They exhibit a forgetting behavior and consequently only recently past information is taken into account for classification purposes. BPS permits online weight updating and it has the same time complexity and space requirements as back-propagation (BP) applied to feedforward networks. We present experimental results for problems connected with Automatic Speech Recognition."
1992,Phonetically motivated acoustic parameters for continuous speech recognition using artificial neural networks.,"Abstract
In the framework of an ANN/HMM hybrid system for phone recognition three specialized ANNs were designed and evaluated. One of these ANNs detects the manner of articulation. The other two ANNs describe the speech signal in terms of place of articulation. One of these is used for plosive and nasal classification, and the other one is used for fricative classification. The design of these networks was inspired by acoustic-phonetic knowledge. Input parameters, ANN topology and desired output representation have been optimized for the specific task of the network. Experiments are reported for the TIMIT database. Frame classification errors of 17.7% with the manner ANN (5 broad classes), 25.4% with the plosive and nasal ANN (10 phones), and 25.2% with the fricative ANN (11 phones) were obtained on a set of 616 sentences from 77 new speakers. Experiments for a prototype ANN/HMM hybrid system are also reported. We developed an algorithm for the global optimization of this hybrid system. The network for the manner of articulation and one network for the place of articulation were merged to a single ANN which outputs were modeled by an HMM. With this globally optimized hybrid system we achieved a recognition accuracy of 86% on an 8 class recognition problem (7 plosives and one class corresponding to all other phonemes).
Zusammenfassung
Im Kontext eines KNN/HMM Hybridsystems fÃ¼r Phonerkennung wurden drei spezialisierte KNN entwickelt und ausgewertet. Eines dieser KNN detektiert die Artikulationsart. Die beiden anderen KNN beschreiben das Sprachsignal mit Merkmalen, die den Artikulationsort charakterisieren. Eines der beiden dient zur Klassifikation von Plosiven bzw.

1992,Global optimization of a neural network-hidden Markov model hybrid.,"Abstract:
The integration of multilayered and recurrent artificial neural networks (ANNs) with hidden Markov models (HMMs) is addressed. ANNs are suitable for approximating functions that compute new acoustic parameters, whereas HMMs have been proven successful at modeling the temporal structure of the speech signal. In the approach described, the ANN outputs constitute the sequence of observation vectors for the HMM. An algorithm is proposed for global optimization of all the parameters. Results on speaker-independent recognition experiments using this integrated ANN-HMM system on the TIMIT continuous speech database are reported.< >"
1991,Phonetically motivated acoustic parameters for continuous speech recognition using artificial neural networks.,"In the framework of an ANN/HMM hybrid system for phone recognition three specialized ANNs were designed and evaluated. One of these ANNs detects the manner of articulation. The other two ANNs describe the speech signal in terms of place of articulation. One of these is used for plosive and nasal classification, and the other one is used for fricative classification. The design of these networks was inspired by acoustic-phonetic knowledge. Input parameters, ANN topology, and desired output representation have been optimized for the specific task of the network. A main advantage of ANNs over statistical classifiers like HMMs is seen in the possibility to use a large unconstrained feature set which can be setup in order to contain all necessary information rather than to fulfill statistical constraints. Experiments are reported for the TIMIT database.

1991,A comparative study on hybrid acoustic phonetic decoders based on artificial neural networks.,"In this paper we compare two hybrid acoustic-phonetic decoders based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate them on the task of recognizing stop phones in continuous speech independently from the speaker. ANNs are well suited to perform detailed phonetic distinctions. In general, techniques based on Dynamic Programming (DP), in particular Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), have proven to be successful at modeling the temporal structure of the speech signal. In the approach described here, the ANN outputs constitute the sequence of observation vectors for the HMM. An algorithm is proposed for global optimization of all the parameters of the ANN/HMM decoder. Comparative experiments using this ANN/HMM hybrid decoder and another ANN-DP hybrid are reported for the TIMIT database.

1991,Neural Network - Gaussian Mixture Hybrid for Speech Recognition or Density Estimation.,"The subject of this paper is the integration of multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with probability density functions such as Gaussian mixtures found in continuous density Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In the first part of this paper we present an ANN/HMM hybrid in which all the parameters of the system are simultaneously optimized with respect to a single criterion. In the second part of this paper, we study the relationship between the density of the inputs of the network and the density of the outputs of the networks.

1990,Efficient recognition of immunoglobulin domains from amino acid sequences using a neural network.,"A neural network was trained using back propagation to recognize immunoglobulin domains from amino acid sequences. The program was designed to identify proteins exhibiting such domains with minimal rates of false positives and false negatives. The National Biomedical Research Foundation NEW protein sequences database was scanned to evaluate the performance of the program in recognizing mouse immunoglobulin sequences. The program correctly recognized 55 out of 56 mouse immunoglobulin sequences, corresponding to a recognition efficiency of 98.2% with an overall false positive rate of 7.3%. These data demonstrate that neural network-based search programs are well suited to search for sequences characterized by only a few well-conserved subsequences.
"
1990,Phonetically-based multi-layered neural networks for vowel classification.,"Abstract
The vowel sub-component of a speaker-independent phoneme classification system will be described. The architecture of the vowel classifier is based on an ear model followed by a set of Multi-Layered Neural Networks (MLNN). MLNNs are trained to learn how to recognize articulatory features like the place of articulation and the manner of articulation related to tongue position.
Experiments are performed on 10 English vowels showing a recognition rate higher than 95% on new speakers. When features are used for recognition, comparable results are obtained for vowels and diphthongs not used for training and pronounced by new speakers. This suggests that MLNNs suitably fed by the data computed by an ear model have good generalization capabilities over new speakers and new sounds.
Zusammenfassung
Beschrieben wird eine Klassifizierungsstufe fÃ¼r Vokale als Teil eines sprecherunabhÃ¤ngigen Phonemklassifizierungssystems. Die Architektur dieses Vokalklassifikators basiert auf einem Ohrmodell, das von einem Satz mehrschichtiger neuronaler Netze gefolgt wird. Diese neuronalen Netze werden darauf trainiert, artikulatorische Merkmale, wie z.B. den Ort der Artikulation oder die Art der Artikulation â€” bezogen auf die Position der Zunge â€” zu erkennen.
Experimente mit 10 englischen Vokalen ergeben eine Erkennungsrate von mehr als 95% fÃ¼r neue, dem System bisher unbekannte Sprecher. Werden phonetische Merkmale fÃ¼r die Erkennung herangezogen, so lassen sich vergleichbare Resultate fÃ¼r solche Vokale und Diphthonge erreichen, die fÃ¼r das Training nicht verwendet oder von neuen Sprechern geÃ¤uÎ²ert wurden. Dies legt nahe, daÎ² mehrschichtige neuronale Netze, auf passende Weise mit den Ausgangsdaten eines Ohrmodells angesteuert, sich bei der Erweiterung dieser Aufgabe auf neue Sprecher oder neue Laute als gut geeignet erweisen.

Nous prÃ©sentons un systÃ¨me de classification de phonÃ¨mes indÃ©pendant du locuteur et appliquÃ© aux voyelles. L'architecture du classificateur de voyelles est basÃ©e surun modÃ¨le d'oreille suivi d'un ensemble de rÃ©seaux neuronaux Ã  plusieurs couches (MLNN). Les MLNNs apprennent Ã  reconnaÃ®tre les traits articulatoires, par exemple le lieu et le mode d'articulation en relation avec la position de la langue.
Des expÃ©riences ont Ã©tÃ© effectuÃ©es sur 10 voyelles anglaises et montrent un taux de reconnaissance supÃ©rieur Ã  95% sur de nouveaux locuteurs. Lorsque les traits sont utilisÃ©s pour la reconnaissance, des rÃ©sultats comparables sont obtenus pour des voyelles et des dihthongues qui n'ont pas Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©es lors de l'apprentissage et prononcÃ©es par de nouveaux locuteurs. Ceci suggÃ¨re que, pour des donnÃ©es calculÃ©es par un modÃ¨le d'oreille, les MLNNs prÃ©sentent un bon pouvoir de gÃ©nÃ©ralisation pour de nouveaux locuteurs et de nouveaux sons."
1989,Programmable Execution of Multi-Layered Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition.,"A set of Multi-Layered Networks allows the integration of information extracted with variable resolution in the time and frequency domains and to keep the number of links between nodes of the networks small for significant generalization during learning with a reasonable training set size.

1989,On the Generalization Capability of Multi-Layered Networks in the Extraction of Speech Properties.,"The paper describes a speech coding system based on an ear model followed by a set of MultiLayer Networks (MLN). MLNs are trained to learn how to recognize articulatory features like the place and manner of articulation. Experiments are performed on 10 English vowels showing a recognition rate higher than 95% for new speakers. When features are used for recognition, comparable results are obtained for vowels and diphthongs not used for training and pronounced by new speakers. This suggests that MLNs suitably fed by the data computed by an ear model have good generalization capabilities over new speakers and new sounds."
1989,Speaker Independent Speech Recognition with Neural Networks and Speech Knowledge.,"We attempt to combine neural networks with knowledge from speech science to build a speaker independent speech recognition system. This knowledge is utilized in designing the preprocessing, input coding, output coding, output supervision and architectural constraints. To handle the temporal aspect of speech we combine delays, copies of activations of hidden and output units at the input level, and Back-Propagation for Sequences (BPS), a learning algorithm for networks with local self-loops. This strategy is demonstrated in several experiments, in particular a nasal discrimination task for which the application of a speech theory hypothesis dramatically improved generalization."
1989,A Neural Network to Detect Homologies in Proteins.,"In order to detect the presence and location of immunoglobulin (Ig) domains from amino acid sequences we built a system based on a neural network with one hidden layer trained with back propagation. The program was designed to efficiently identify proteins exhibiting such domains, characterized by a few localized conserved regions and a low overall homology. When the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) NEW protein sequence database was scanned to evaluate the program's performance, we obtained very low rates of false negatives coupled with a moderate rate of false positives."
1988,Data-Driven Execution of Multi-Layered Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition.,A set of Multi-Layered Networks (MLN) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is proposed. Such a set allows the integration of information extracted with variable resolution in the time and frequency domains and to keep the number of links between nodes of the networks small in order to allow significant generalization during learning with a reasonable training set size. Subsets of networks can be executed depending on preconditions based on descriptions of the time evolution of signal energies allowing spectral properties that are significant in different acoustic situations to be learned. Preliminary experiments on speaker-independent recognition of the letters of the E-set are reported. Voices from 70 speakers were used for learning. Voices of 10 new speakers were used for test. An overall error rate of 9.5% was obtained in the test showing that results better than those previously reported can be achieved.
1988,Use of Multi-Layered Networks for Coding Speech with Phonetic Features.,"Preliminary results on speaker-independant speech recognition are reported. A method that combines expertise on neural networks with expertise on speech recognition is used to build the recognition systems. For transient sounds, event-driven property extractors with variable resolution in the time and frequency domains are used. For sonorant speech, a model of the human auditory system is preferred to FFT as a front-end module. "
