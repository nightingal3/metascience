2012,An Algorithmic View of the Universe.,"In the years since Alan Turing, and following his lead, computer scientists advanced their understanding of computational phenomena by developing a very specialized, original and penetrating way of rigorous thinking. Now it turns out that this ""algorithmic"" way of thinking can be applied productively to the study of important phenomena outside computation proper (examples: the cell, the brain, the market, the universe, indeed mathematical truth itself). This development is an exquisite unintended consequence of the fact that there is latent computation underlying each of these phenomena, or the ways in which science studies them."
2009,The Undecidability of the Infinite Ribbon Problem: Implications for Computing by Self-Assembly.,"Self-assembly, the process by which objects autonomously come together to form complex structures, is omnipresent in the physical world. Recent experiments in self-assembly demonstrate its potential for the parallel creation of a large number of nanostructures, including possibly computers. A systematic study of self-assembly as a mathematical process has been initiated by L. Adleman and E. Winfree. The individual components are modeled as square tiles on the infinite two-dimensional plane. Each side of a tile is covered by a specific ìglue,î and two adjacent tiles will stick iff they have matching glues on their abutting edges. Tiles that stick to each other may form various two-dimensional ìstructuresî such as squares and rectangles, or may cover the entire plane. In this paper we focus on a special type of structure, called a ribbon: a non-self-crossing rectilinear sequence of tiles on the plane, in which successive tiles are adjacent along an edge and abutting edges of consecutive tiles have matching glues. We prove that it is undecidable whether an arbitrary finite set of tiles with glues (infinite supply of each tile type available) can be used to assemble an infinite ribbon. While the problem can be proved undecidable using existing techniques if the ribbon is required to start with a given ìseedî tile, our result settles the ìunseededî case, an open problem formerly known as the ìunlimited infinite snake problem.î The proof is based on a construction, due to R. Robinson, of a special set of tiles that allow only aperiodic tilings of the plane. This construction is used to create a special set of directed tiles (tiles with arrows painted on the top) with the ìstrong plane-filling propertyîóa variation of the ìplane-filling propertyî previously defined by J. Kari. A construction of ìsandwichî tiles is then used in conjunction with this special tile set, to reduce the well-known undecidable tiling problem to the problem of the existence of an infinite directed zipper (a special kind of ribbon). A ìmotifî construction is then introduced that allows one tile system to simulate another by using geometry to represent glues. Using motifs, the infinite directed zipper problem is reduced to the infinite ribbon problem, proving the latter undecidable. An immediate consequence of our result is the undecidability of the existence of arbitrarily large structures self-assembled using tiles from a given tile set.

2002,Combinatorial optimization problems in self-assembly.,"Self-assembly is the ubiquitous process by which simple objects autonomously assemble into intricate complexes. It has been suggested that intricate self-assembly processes will ultimately be used in circuit fabrication, nano-robotics, DNA computation, and amorphous computing. In this paper, we study two combinatorial optimization problems related to efficient self-assembly of shapes in the Tile Assembly Model of self-assembly proposed by Rothemund and Winfree [18]. The first is the Minimum Tile Set Problem, where the goal is to find the smallest tile system that uniquely produces a given shape. The second is the Tile Concentrations Problem, where the goal is to decide on the relative concentrations of different types of tiles so that a tile system assembles as quickly as possible. The first problem is akin to finding optimum program size, and the second to finding optimum running time for a ""program"" to assemble the shape.Self-assembly is the ubiquitous process by which simple objects autonomously assemble into intricate complexes.

In order to prove that the problem is in NP, we present a polynomial time algorithm to verify whether a given tile system uniquely produces a given shape. This algorithm is analogous to a program verifier for traditional computational systems, and may well be of independent interest. For the second problem, we present a polynomial time $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm that works for a large class of tile systems that we call partial order systems."
2001,Counting Points on Curves and Abelian Varieties Over Finite Fields.,"Abstract
We develop efficient methods for deterministic computations with semi-algebraic sets and apply them to the problem of counting points on curves and Abelian varieties over finite fields. For Abelian varieties of dimension g in projective N space overFq, we improve Pila‚Äôs result and show that the problem can be solved in O((

2001,Running time and program size for self-assembled squares.,"Recently Rothemund and Winfree [6] have considered the program size complexity of constructing squares by self-assembly. Here, we consider the time complexity of such constructions using a natural generalization of the Tile Assembly Model defined in [6]. In the generalized model, the Rothemund-Winfree construction of n \times n squares requires time &THgr;(n log n) and program size &THgr;(log n). We present a new construction for assembling n \times n squares which uses optimal time &THgr;(n) and program size &THgr;(\frac{log n}{log log n}). This program size is also optimal since it matches the bound dictated by Kolmogorov complexity. Our improved time is achieved by demonstrating a set of tiles for parallel self-assembly of binary counters. Our improved program size is achieved by demonstrating that self-assembling systems can compute changes in the base representation of numbers. Self-assembly is emerging as a useful paradigm for computation. In addition the development of a computational theory of self-assembly promises to provide a new conduit by which results and methods of theoretical computer science might be applied to problems of interest in biology and the physical sciences."

1999,A Subexponential Algorithm for Discrete Logarithms over Hyperelliptic Curves of Large Genus over GF(q).,"Abstract
There are well-known subexponential algorithms for finding discrete logarithms over finite fields. However, the methods which underlie these algorithms do not appear to be easily adaptable for finding discrete logarithms in the groups associated with elliptic curves and the Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves, except for very special cases (Menezes et al., IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 39 (1993) 1639‚Äì1646, Okamoto and Sakurai, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 576, Springer, Berlin, 1991). This has led to the development of cryptographic systems based on the discrete logarithm problem for such groups (Koblitz, Math. Comput. 48 (1987) 203‚Äì209, J. Cryptogr. 1 (1989) 139‚Äì150, Menezes, Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptosystems, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1993, Miller, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin, 1986, pp. 417‚Äì 426). In this paper a subexponential algorithm is presented for finding discrete logarithms in the group of rational points on the Jacobians of large genus hyperelliptic curves over prime fields.

1998,A Sticker-Based Model for DNA Computation.,"We introduce a new model of molecular computation that we call the sticker model. Like many previous proposals it makes use of DNA strands as the physical substrate in which information is represented and of separation by hybridization as a central mechanism. However, unlike previous models, the stickers model has a random access memory that requires no strand extension and uses no enzymes; also (at least in theory), its materials are reusable. The paper describes computation under the stickers model and discusses possible means for physically implementing each operation. Finally, we go on to propose a specific machine architecture for implementing the stickers model as a microprocessor-controlled parallel robotic workstation.

In the course of this development a number of previous general concerns about molecular computation (Smith, 1996; Hartmanis, 1995; Linial et al., 1995) are addressed. First, it is clear that general-purpose algorithms can be implemented by DNA-based computers, potentially solving a wide class of search problems. Second, we find that there are challenging problems, for which only modest volumes of DNA should suffice. Third, we demonstrate that the formation and breaking of covalent bonds is not intrinsic to DNA-based computation. Fourth, we show that a single essential biotechnology, sequence-specific separation, suffices for constructing a general-purpose molecular computer. Concerns about errors in this separation operation and means to reduce them are addressed elsewhere (Karp et al., 1995; Roweis and Winfree, 1999). Despite these encouraging theoretical advances, we emphasize that substantial engineering challenges remain at almost all stages and that the ultimate success or failure of DNA computing will certainly depend on whether these challenges can be met in laboratory investigations."
1997,Quantum Computability.,"In this paper some theoretical and (potentially) practical aspects of quantum computing are considered. Using the tools of transcendental number theory it is demonstrated that quantum Turing machines (QTM) with rational amplitudes are sufficient to define the class of bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) introduced by Bernstein and Vazirani [Proc. 25th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation, 1993, pp. 11--20, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277--1339]. On the other hand, if quantum Turing machines are allowed unrestricted amplitudes (i.e., arbitrary complex amplitudes), then the corresponding BQP class has uncountable cardinality and contains sets of all Turing degrees. In contrast, allowing unrestricted amplitudes does not increase the power of computation for error-free quantum polynomial time (EQP). Moreover, with unrestricted amplitudes, BQP is not equal to EQP. The relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical complexity classes is also investigated. It is shown that when quantum Turing machines are restricted to have transition amplitudes which are algebraic numbers, BQP, EQP, and nondeterministic quantum polynomial time (NQP) are all contained in PP, hence in ${\rm P}^{#{\rm P}}$ and PSPACE. A potentially practical issue of designing ""machine independent"" quantum programs is also addressed. A single (""almost universal"") quantum algorithm based on Shor's method for factoring integers is developed which would run correctly on almost all quantum computers, even if the underlying unitary transformations are unknown to the programmer and the device builder.

1990,Fast Checkers for Cryptography.,"Abstract
Program correctness is a serious concern, and has consequently received considerable attention. This attention has taken three approaches:
mathematical: prove programs correct;
empirical: test programs for bugs; and
engineering: design programs well.
While considerable progress has been made, the question of whether a given computation was performed correctly still has no practical solution. However, a new approach, proposed by Manuel Blum, promises to be both practical and of theoretical significance, and is intrinsically closer to a computer scientist‚Äôs heart, since the approach is
algorithmic: check every computation using a progmm checker. Program checkers are designed for specific computational problems; a checker is then an algorithm such that, given a program that is supposed to solve that problem, and an input value, if the program computes correctly at that input, the checker says ‚ÄúCORRECT‚Äù (with a small probability of error); alternately, if the program has a bug, it says ‚ÄúBUGGY‚Äù (again, with a small chance of error)."

1983,A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems (Reprint).,"An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. A message can be ‚Äúsigned‚Äù using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in ‚Äúelectronic mail‚Äù and ‚Äúelectronic funds transfer‚Äù systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n."

We are unable to present a rigorous proof that the attacks presented here are effective. However, in the case of the Graham-Shamir system, the methods have been implemented and have performed well in tests. The method of attack uses recent results of Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz [5].

We introduce reductions that lie and sometimes produce outputs y Œµ B when x ? A. We will use these reductions to further clarify the computational complexity of some problems raised by Gauss."
1978,Improved Time and Space Bounds for Boolean Matrix Multiplication.,"Summary
Using modular arithmetic we obtain the following improved bounds on the time and space complexities for n √ó n Boolean matrix multiplication: O(nlog27 lognlogloglognloglogloglogn) bit operations and O(n2loglog n) bits of storage on a logarithmic cost RAM having no multiply or divide instruction; O(nlog27(logn)2‚àí1/2log27(loglog n)1/2log27‚àí1) bit operations and O(n2log n) bits of storage on a RAM which can use indirect addressing for table lookups. The first algorithm can be realized as a Boolean circuit with O(nlog27lognlogloglognloglogloglogn) gates. Whenever n√ón arithmetic matrix multiplication can be performed in less than O(nlog27) arithmetic operations, our results have corresponding improvements."
1978,A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems.,"An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be ‚Äúsigned‚Äù using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in ‚Äúelectronic mail‚Äù and ‚Äúelectronic funds transfer‚Äù systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ‚â° 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n."
1978,NP-Complete Decision Problems for Binary Quadratics.,"Abstract
The computational complexity of deciding whether a polynomial with integer coefficients has natural-number zeros ranges from deterministic polynomial time feasibility (for polynomials in one variable or of degree one) to undecidability (presently known to hold for polynomials in nine or more variables). We show that for the two-variable quadratics of the form Œ±x2 + Œ≤y ‚àí Œ≥ = 0; Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ œµ œâ, the problem is NP-complete. This implies NP-completeness of certain questions about the solutions x of x2 = Œ± modulo Œ≤; Œ±, Œ≤, Œæ œµ œâ. It also shows that a nondeterministic Turing machine restricted to evaluating deterministically polynomials of a given form at nondeterministically constructed argument values (called a nondeterministic Diophantine machine below) can solve an NP-complete problem in polynomial time."
1978,Two Theorems on Random Polynomial Time.,"The use of randomness in computation was first studied in abstraction by Gill [4]. In recent years its use in both practical and theoretical areas has become apparent. Strassen and Solovay [10]; Miller [7]; and Rabin [8] have used it to transform primality testing into a (for many purposes) tractible problem. We can see in retrospect that it was implicit in algorithms by Ber1ekamp [2], Lehmer [6], and Cippola [3] (1903!). Where the traditional method of polynomial reduction has been inapplicable, randomness has been used in demonstrating intractibility by Adleman and Manders [1], and in showing problems equivalent by Rabin [9]. In light of these developments and the insights they provide, a new examination of randomness is in order."

1977,"Reducibility, Randomness, and Intractability (Abstract).","The method of showing a problem NP-complete by polynomial reduction is one of the most elegant and productive in our theory ([ 1 ], [ 3 ]). It is a means of providing compelling evidence that a problem in NP is not in P. In this paper we will demonstrate new methods for showing this. Our methods, based on a new notion of reducibility (gamma-reducibility) are apparently of more general applicability than that of polynomial reduction and are intended to be of practical value to researchers in the field. We use our methods to ‚Äúdemonstrate‚Äù (i.e., give compelling evidence) that some natural problems in NP which are not known to be NP-complete are, nonetheless, not in P."
1976,Diophantine Complexity.,n/a
1976,NP-Complete Decision Problems for Quadratic Polynomials.,"In this article we show the NP-completeness of some simple number-theoretic problems. Natural simplifications of these problems invariably are known to be in P. Our research was motivated by the question whether one could study non-deterministic computation without loss of generality on a restricted, number theoretically significant class of nondeterministic Turing machines, the nondeterministic diophantine machines defined below [1,2]. The results suggest this is true. Because of the relative difficulty of the reduction of the satisfiability problem used in the proof, and the distinctly number-theoretic character of the problems shown to be NP-complete, we hope that the NP-completeness of these problems will play a role in showing the NP-completeness of further problems of a numerical nature, much as the satisfiability problem has in showing the NP-completeness of combinatorial problems ([3],[5]). The results illustrate an intimate connection between problems in computational theory, such as ‚ÄúP&equil;NP?‚Äù, and problems in number theory, e.g. about quadratic congruences in one unknown, which are just beyond the range in which efficient algorithms exist. Thus our work exposes an interface between the state-of-the-art in number theory and in the theory of computation. Also, our results can be seen as the solution to a natural and important revision of Hilbert's 10thproblem: Give a feasible algorithmic procedure to decide whether an arbitrary diophantine equation has solutions. Unless P&equil;NP this is impossible, even for a class of quadratic diophantine equations in two unknowns for which a decision procedure in the original sense is in fact available. Certainly, these results present a striking rigorous demonstration that number theorists' intuitions about where problems about diophantine equations and quadratic congruences start to be truly difficult are justified."

1974,Short permutation strings.,"Abstract
A permutation string is a string of symbols over the numerals 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n such that all permutations of the string 1 2 ‚Ä¶ n are subsequences. The search for short permutation strings arose out of studies into the complexity of shortest path algorithms by Karp and others. The results in the sequel are presented independent of such studies because they are felt to be of intrinsic combinatorial interest [1]. An algorithm for constructing permutation strings of length n2‚àí2n+4 is given."
