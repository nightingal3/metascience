2019,Symmetry Properties of Nested Canalyzing Functions.,"Many researchers have studied symmetry properties of various Boolean functions. A class of Boolean functions, called nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), has been used to model certain biological phenomena. We identify some interesting relationships between NCFs, symmetric Boolean functions and a generalization of symmetric Boolean functions, which we call r-symmetric functions (where r is the symmetry level). Using a normalized representation for NCFs, we develop a characterization of when two variables of an NCF are symmetric. Using this characterization, we show that the symmetry level of an NCF f can be easily computed given a standard representation of f. We also present an algorithm for testing whether a given r-symmetric function is an NCF. Further, we show that for any NCF f with n variables, the notion of strong asymmetry considered in the literature is equivalent to the property that f is n-symmetric. We use this result to derive a closed form expression for the number of n-variable Boolean functions that are NCFs and strongly asymmetric. We also identify all the Boolean functions that are NCFs and symmetric."
2018,A characterization of nested canalyzing functions with maximum average sensitivity.,"Abstract
Nested canalyzing functions (NCFs) are a class of Boolean functions which are used to model certain biological phenomena. We derive a complete characterization of NCFs with the largest average sensitivity, expressed in terms of a simple structural property of the NCF. This characterization provides an alternate, but elementary, proof of the tight upper bound on the average sensitivity of any NCF established by Klotz et al. (2013). We also utilize the characterization to derive a closed form expression for the number of NCFs that have the largest average sensitivity."
2018,"Learning the Behavior of a Dynamical System Via a ""20 Questions"" Approach.","Using a graphical discrete dynamical system to model a networked social system, the problem of inferring the behavior of the system can be formulated as the problem of learning the local functions of the dynamical system. We investigate the problem assuming an active form of interaction with the system through queries. We consider two classes of local functions (namely, symmetric and threshold functions) and two interaction modes, namely batch mode (where all the queries must be submitted together) and adaptive mode (where the set of queries submitted at a stage may rely on the answers received to previous queries). We develop complexity results and efficient heuristics that produce query sets under both query modes. We demonstrate the performance of our heuristics through experiments on over 20 well-known networks."
2018,Testing Phase Space Properties of Synchronous Dynamical Systems with Nested Canalyzing Local Functions.,"Discrete graphical dynamical systems serve as effective formal models in many contexts, including simulations of agent-based models, propagation of contagions in social networks and study of biological phenomena. A class of Boolean functions, called nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), has been used as a good model of certain biological phenomena. Motivated by these biological applications, we study a variety of analysis problems for synchronous graphical dynamical systems (SyDSs) over the Boolean domain, where each local function is an NCF. Each analysis problem involves testing whether the phase space of a given SyDS satisfies a certain property. We present intractability results for some properties as well as efficient algorithms for others. In several cases, our results clearly delineate intractable and efficiently solvable versions of problems."
2018,Inferring Probabilistic Contagion Models Over Networks Using Active Queries.,"The problem of inferring unknown parameters of a networked social system is of considerable practical importance. We consider this problem for the independent cascade model using an active query framework. More specifically, given a network whose edge probabilities are unknown, the goal is to infer the probability value on each edge by querying the system. The optimization objective is to use as few queries as possible in carrying out the inference. We present approximation algorithms that provide provably good estimates of edge probabilities. We also present results from an experimental evaluation of our algorithms on several real-world networks."
2018,Using Active Queries to Learn Local Stochastic Behaviors in Social Networks.,"Abstract
Using a stochastic synchronous dynamical system (SyDS) as a formal model, we study the problem of inferring local behaviors of nodes in networked social systems. We focus on probabilistic threshold functions as local functions. We use an active query mechanism where a user interacts with the system by submitting queries. We develop an efficient algorithm that infers the probabilistic threshold functions using the responses to the queries. Our algorithm generates provably good query sets. We also present experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm."
2018,Computational Aspects of Fault Location and Resilience Problems for Interdependent Infrastructure Networks.,"Abstract
Motivated by applications in diagnosing failures in complex infrastructure networks, we consider the configuration sequence completion problem (CSC) for networked systems. The goal of the CSC problem is to choose values for unknown entries in a specified sequence of configurations of a system so that the resulting sequence represents a valid trajectory of the system. This problem generalizes some known decision problems for dynamical systems. We present efficient algorithms for some versions of the CSC problem and computational intractability results for other versions."
2017,Inferring local transition functions of discrete dynamical systems from observations of system behavior.,"Abstract
We consider the problem of inferring the local transition functions of discrete dynamical systems from observed behavior. Our focus is on synchronous systems whose local transition functions are threshold functions. We assume that the topology of the system is known and that the goal is to infer a threshold value for each node so that the system produces the observed behavior. We show that some of these inference problems are efficiently solvable while others are NP-complete, even when the underlying graph of the dynamical system is a simple path. We identify a fixed parameter tractable problem in this context. We also consider constrained versions of threshold inference problems where the input includes a set of equality or inequality constraints (which specify pairs of nodes which must have the same threshold value or different threshold values). We present algorithmic and complexity results for several constrained threshold inference problems."
2015,Analysis Problems for Graphical Dynamical Systems: A Unified Approach Through Graph Predicates.,"We present a unified approach for studying the complexity of analysis problems for Synchronous Dynamical Systems (SyDSs), a class of graphical models for networked multiagent systems. Our approach uses predicates based on graph embeddings to capture many phase space properties of SyDSs studied in the literature and additional properties which have not been considered previously. Using this formalism, we develop general results to show that many analysis problems for SyDSs are computationally intractable. However, when the underlying graph of the given SyDS is treewidth bounded and the local functions are r-symmetric (for any fixed r), we show that even counting versions of analysis problems can be solved efficiently."

2013,Attributed Translations.,"Abstract
Attributed translation grammars are introduced as a means of specifying a translation from strings of input symbols to strings of output symbols. Each of these symbols can have a finite set of attributes, each of which can take on a value from a possibly infinite set. Attributed translation grammars can be applied in depth to practical compiling problems.
Certain augmented pushdown machines are defined and characterizations are given of the attributed translations they can perform both deterministically and nondeterministically. Classes of attributed translation grammars are defined whose translation can be performed deterministically while parsing top down or bottom up."
2013,An analysis of several heuristics for the traveling salesman problem.,"Abstract
Several polynomial time algorithms finding ‚Äúgood,‚Äù but not necessarily optimal, tours for the traveling salesman problem are considered. We measure the closeness of a tour by the ratio of the obtained tour length to the minimal tour length. For the nearest neighbor method, we show the ratio is bounded above by a logarithmic function of the number of nodes. We also provide a logarithmic lower bound on the worst case. A class of approximation methods we call insertion methods are studied, and these are also shown to have a logarithmic upper bound. For two specific insertion methods, which we call nearest insertion and cheapest insertion, the ratio is shown to have a constant upper bound of 2, and examples are provided that come arbitrarily close to this upper bound. It is also shown that for any n‚â•8, there are traveling salesman problems with n nodes having tours which cannot be improved by making n/4 edge changes, but for which the ratio is 2(1‚àí1/n)."
2013,System Level Concurrency Control for Distributed Database Systems.,"Abstract
A distributed database system is one in which the database is spread among several sites and application programs ‚Äúmove‚Äù from site to site to access and update the data they need. The concurrency control is that portion of the system that responds to the read and write requests of the application programs. Its job is to maintain the global consistency of the distributed database while ensuring that the termination of the application programs is not prevented by phenomena such as deadlock. We assume each individual site has its own local concurrency control which responds to requests at that site and can only communicate with concurrency controls at other sites when an application program moves from site to site, terminates, or aborts.
This paper presents designs for several distributed concurrency controls and demonstrates that they work correctly. It also investigates some of the implications of global consistency of a distributed database and discusses phenomena that can prevent termination of application programs."
2013,Consistency and serializability in concurrent database systems.,"Abstract
The main results of this paper show that serialization is both necessary and sufficient for consistency in concurrent database systems. This is true for both the final database and the views of the database seen by individual transactions. The model of a transaction includes both read and write operations which may be performed in any order (except an entity must be read before being written).
The main results are presented in terms of an information flow model describing the source of each value read and the use of each value written. Since the model does not involve any concept of the ‚Äútime‚Äù a value was read or written, it models any concurrency system producing information flow among transactions.
There is a section discussing the effect of changing the model to include write operations without preceding reads, and a section discussing the restriction to straight-line programs."
2013,Sums-of-Products and Subproblem Independence.,"Abstract
Sums-of-products provide a basis for describing certain computational problems, particularly problems related to constraint satisfaction including SAT, MAX SAT, and #SAT. They also can be used to describe many problems arising from graph theory. By modeling a problem as a sum-of-products problem, the concept of ‚Äúsubproblem independence‚Äù takes on a clear meaning. Subproblem independence has immediate computational implications since it can be used to create programs with reduced levels of nesting and programs which exploit memoization. The concept of subproblem independence also extends to quantified sums.
Subproblem independence can be linked directly to structural concepts associated with tree decompositions for graphs and the closely related structure trees for algebraic problems. Thus methods of finding tree decompositions apply directly to finding independent subproblems."
2011,Modeling and analyzing social network dynamics using stochastic discrete graphical dynamical systems.,"Abstract
Motivated by applications such as the spread of epidemics and the propagation of influence in social networks, we propose a formal model for analyzing the dynamics of such networks. Our model is a stochastic version of discrete graphical dynamical systems. Using this model, we formulate and study the computational complexity of two fundamental problems (called reachability and predecessor existence problems) which arise in the context of social networks. We also address other problems that deal with the time evolution of such stochastic dynamical systems. Further, we point out the implications of our results to problems for other computational models such as Hopfield networks, communicating finite state machines and systolic arrays. In particular, our polynomial time algorithms for the predecessor existence problem for stochastic dynamical systems imply similar results for one-dimensional finite cellular automata."
2007,Predecessor existence problems for finite discrete dynamical systems.,"Abstract
We study the predecessor existence problem for finite discrete dynamical systems. Given a finite discrete dynamical system
and a configuration
, the Predecessor existence (or Pre) problem is to determine whether there is a configuration
such that
has a transition from
to
. In addition to the decision version, we also study the following variants: the #-Predecessor existence (or #Pre) problem‚Äìcounting the number of predecessors, the Unique-Predecessor existence (or UPre) problem‚Äìdeciding whether there is a unique predecessor and the Ambiguous-Predecessor existence (or APre) problem‚Äìgiven a configuration
and a predecessor
of
, deciding whether there is a different predecessor
of 
.
General techniques are presented for simultaneously characterizing the computational complexity of the Pre problem and its three variants. Our hardness results are based on the concept of simultaneous reductions: single transformations that can be used to simultaneously prove the hardness of the different variants of the Pre problem for their respective complexity classes. Our easiness results are based on dynamic programming and they extend the previous results on Pre problem for one-dimensional cellular automata. The hardness results together with the easiness results provide a tight separation between easy and hard instances.
Further, the results imply similar bounds for other classes of finite discrete dynamical systems including discrete Hopfield and recurrent neural networks, concurrent state machines, systolic networks and one- and two-dimensional cellular automata. Our results extend the earlier results of Green, Sutner and Orponen on the complexity of the predecessor existence problem and its variants."
2007,Computational Aspects of Analyzing Social Network Dynamics.,"Motivated by applications in diagnosing failures in complex infrastructure networks, we consider the configuration sequence completion problem (CSC) for networked systems. The goal of the CSC problem is to choose values for unknown entries in a specified sequence of configurations of a system so that the resulting sequence represents a valid trajectory of the system. This problem generalizes some known decision problems for dynamical systems. We present efficient algorithms for some versions of the CSC problem and computational intractability results for other versions.

2006,Complexity of reachability problems for finite discrete dynamical systems.,"Abstract
Sequential Dynamical Systems (SDSs) are a special type of finite discrete dynamical systems that can be used to model simulation systems. We focus on the computational complexity of testing several phase space properties of SDSs. Our main result is a sharp delineation between classes of SDSs whose behavior is easy to predict and those whose behavior is hard to predict. Specifically, we show the following.
1.
Several state reachability problems for SDSs are PSPACE-complete, even when restricted to SDSs whose underlying graphs are of bounded bandwidth (and hence of bounded pathwidth and treewidth), and the function associated with each node is symmetric. Moreover, this result holds even when the underlying graph is d-regular for some constant d and all the nodes compute the same symmetric Boolean function. An immediate corollary of this result is a PSPACE-hard lower bound on the complexity of reachability problems for regular generalized 1D-Cellular Automata and undirected systolic networks with Boolean totalistic local transition functions.
2.
In contrast, the above reachability problems are solvable in polynomial time for SDSs when the Boolean function associated with each node is symmetric and monotone.
The PSPACE-completeness results follow as corollaries of simulation results which show for several classes of SDSs, how one class of SDSs can be efficiently simulated by another (more restricted) class of SDSs. We also prove several structural properties concerning the phase space of an SDS. SDSs are closely related to Cellular Automata (CA), concurrent transition systems, discrete Hopfield networks and systolic networks. This observation in conjunction with our lower bounds for SDSs, yields new PSPACE-hard lower bounds on the complexity of state reachability problems for these models, extending some of the earlier results in [K. Culik II, J. Karhum√§ki, On totalistic systolic networks, Inform. Process. Lett. 26 (5) (1988) 231‚Äì236; P. Flor√©en, E. Goles, G. Weisbuch, Transient length in sequential iterations of threshold functions, Discrete Appl. Math. 6 (1983) 95‚Äì98; P. Flor√©en, P.

2005,Mechanism design for software agents with complete information.,"Abstract
We investigate the mechanism design problem when the agents and the mechanism have computational restrictions. In particular, we examine how results in the mechanism design literature are affected when the social choice rule requires the mechanism to solve a computationally difficult optimization problem. Both dominant strategy and Nash implementation are considered for a multiagent version of the maximum satisfiability problem. We show that the best a mechanism can guarantee is that at least half of the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable agents will be satisfied by the outcome. Our analysis highlights some of the difficulties that arise in applying results from mechanism design to computational problems. In particular, our results show that using approximation in multiagent settings can be much less successful than in traditional computational settings because of the game theoretic guarantees required of the outcomes."
2005,Resource Bounds and Subproblem Independence.,"Abstract
There are several reasons why some NP-hard problems can be solved deterministically in 2O(n^a) time for some a, 0 < a < 1. One reason is that the problem can be solved with a nondeterministic procedure which uses only O(na) space. A second reason is that each instance of the problem exhibits a high degree of ""subproblem independence"" (specifically O(na) line channelwidth or treewidth). A third is that each instance of the problem can be solved using nondeterministic straight-line programs where the number of variables is only O(na). In this paper we show that, after imposing q-linear bounds on the computation time and obliviousness constraints on the nondeterminism, these three reasons are essentially equivalent. (q-Linear functions are similar to functions of the form n (log n)k.) Specifically, the problem classes associated with these reasons are interchangeable using reductions which are simultaneously polynomial time and q-linear size-bounded. We call these PQ-reductions. The classes of problems solvable by these methods we call NQna. Because these classes are defined in a very general way, they include a rich variety of problems. We take this as evidence that these classes have ""power index"" a (i.e., that 2O(n^a) is also a lower time bound). On the other hand, the easiness of all these problems can be derived from ""subproblem independence"" considerations, and thus the techniques associated with subproblem independence are seen to be more widely applicable than one might expect."
2003,On finite strategy sets for finitely repeated zero-sum games.,"Abstract
We study finitely repeated two-person zero-sum games in which Player 1 is restricted to mixing over a fixed number of pure strategies while Player 2 is unrestricted. We describe an optimal set of pure strategies for Player 1 along with an optimal mixed strategy. We show that the entropy of this mixed strategy appears as a factor in an exact formula for the value of the game and thus is seen to have a direct numerical effect on the game's value. We develop upper and lower bounds on the value of these games that are within an additive constant and discuss how our results are related to the work of Neyman and Okada on strategic entropy (Neyman and Okada, 1999, Games Econ. Behav. 29, 191‚Äì223). Finally, we use these results to bound the value of repeated games in which one of the players uses a computer with a bounded memory and is further restricted to using a constant amount of time at each stage."
2003,Deterministic versus nondeterministic time and lower bound problems.,"Because many problems of general interest have natural nondeterministic algorithms and because computers act deterministically, it is important to understand the relationship between deterministic and nondeterministic time. Specifically, it is important to understand how quickly a deterministic computing device can determine the outcome of a nondeterministic calculation. So far, we have no general techniques that work any better than trying all step-by-step simulations, an exponential method.The most famous question concerning determinism versus nondeterminism is the P = NP question. However, this is a different question than ""what is the relationship?"" and it is possible that significant progress about the relationship can be achieved without answering the Pv = NP question. Thanks to efficient reductions from Turing machine simulation to SAT, the relationship question can be posed as a question about SAT. The problem of proving a nontrivial lower bound on the time required to solve SAT is just an instance of the larger problem of proving lower bounds for any natural problem. It is suggested that a study of generic problems might be a fruitful approach toward insights on such problems."
2003,Reachability problems for sequential dynamical systems with threshold functions.,"Abstract
A sequential dynamical system (SDS) over a domain
is a triple
, where (i) G(V,E) is an undirected graph with n nodes with each node having a state value from
, (ii)
is a set of local transition functions with fi denoting the local transition function associated with node vi and (iii) œÄ is a permutation of (i.e., a total order on) the nodes in V. A single SDS transition is obtained by updating the states of the nodes in V by evaluating the function associated with each of them in the order given by œÄ.
We consider reachability problems for SDSs with restricted local transition functions. Our main intractability results show that the reachability problems for SDSs are PSPACE-complete when either of the following restrictions hold: (i)
consists of both simple-threshold-functions and simple-inverted-threshold functions, or (ii)
consists only of threshold-functions that use weights in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, the results hold even for SDSs whose underlying graphs have bounded node degree and bounded pathwidth. Our lower bound results also extend to reachability problems for Hopfield networks and communicating finite state machines.
On the positive side, we show that when
consists only of threshold functions that use weights in a symmetric manner, reachability problems can be solved efficiently provided all the weights are strictly positive and the ratio of the largest to the smallest weight is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of nodes."
2003,Predecessor and Permutation Existence Problems for Sequential Dynamical Systems.,"A class of finite discrete dynamical systems, called Sequential Dynamical Systems (SDSs), was introduced in [BR99] as a formal model for analyzing simulation systems. Here, we address the complexity of two basic problems and their generalizations for SDSs.Given an SDS S and a configuration C, the PREDECESSOR EXISTENCE (or PRE) problem is to determine whether there is a configuration C? such that S has a transition from C? to C. Our results provide separations between efficiently solvable and computationally intractable instances of the PRE problem. For example, we show that the PRE problem can be solved efficiently for SDSs with Boolean state values when the node functions are symmetric and the underlying graph is of bounded tree width. In contrast, we show that allowing just one non-symmetric node function renders the problem NP-complete even when the underlying graph is a star (which has a tree width of 1). Our results extend some of the earlier results by Sutner [Su95] and Green [Gr87] on the complexity of the PREDECESSOR EXISTENCE problem for 1-dimensional cellular automata.Given two configurations C and C? of a partial SDS S, the PERMUTATION EXISTENCE (or PME) problem is to determine whether there is a permutation of nodes such that S has a transition from C? to C in one step. We show that the PME problem is NP-complete even when the function associated with each node is a simple-threshold function. We also show that the problem can be solved efficiently for SDSs whose underlying graphs are of bounded degree and bounded tree width. We consider a generalized version (GEN-PME) of the PME problem and show that the problem is NP-complete for SDSs where each node function is NOR and the underlying graph has a maximum node degree of 3. When each node computes the OR function or when each node computes the AND function, we show that the GEN-PME problem is solvable in polynomial time."
2002,Parallel Approximation Schemes for a Class of Planar and Near Planar Combinatorial Optimization Problems.,"Abstract
Define a (Œ¥, g)-almost planar graph to be a graph G(V, E) consisting of vertex set V and a genus g layout with at most Œ¥¬∑|V| crossover nodes. We study a class of combinatorial optimization problems formulated as follows. Let X={x1, x2,‚Ä¶xn} be a set of variables each of which has a finite domain D={0, 1,‚Ä¶,poly(n)}. Also, let S be a fixed finite set of finite arity relations {R1,‚Ä¶Rq}. The optimization problem MAX
-RELATION
(S) is the following: Given a set of terms {t1, t2,‚Ä¶,tm}, where each term ti is of the form f(xi1, xi2,‚Ä¶,xir) for some fœµS, assign values to each xi, 1‚â§i‚â§n, so as to maximize the number of satisfied terms. We show that for each fixed finite set S and fixed Œ¥, g‚â•0, there is an NC-approximation scheme (NCAS) for the problem MAX
-RELATION
(S) when restricted to instances whose bipartite graphs (that represent the variable-term relationship) are (Œ¥, g)-almost planar. This result in conjunction with approximation-preserving reductions to MAX
-RELATION
(S) enables us to obtain NCASs for a number of graph theoretic and satisfiability problems when restricted to (Œ¥, g)-almost planar instances. Our results provide a characterization of a class of problems having an NCAS (and hence a PTAS)."
2002,Exploiting structure in quantified formulas.,"Abstract
We study the computational problem ‚Äúfind the value of the quantified formula obtained by quantifying the variables in a sum of terms.‚Äù The ‚Äúsum‚Äù can be based on any commutative monoid, the ‚Äúquantifiers‚Äù need only satisfy two simple conditions, and the variables can have any finite domain. This problem is a generalization of the problem ‚Äúgiven a sum-of-products of terms, find the value of the sum‚Äù studied in [R.E. Stearns and H.B. Hunt III, SIAM J. Comput. 25 (1996) 448‚Äì476]. A data structure called a ‚Äústructure tree‚Äù is defined which displays information about ‚Äúsubproblems‚Äù that can be solved independently during the process of evaluating the formula. Some formulas have ‚Äúgood‚Äù structure trees which enable certain generic algorithms to evaluate the formulas in significantly less time than by brute force evaluation. By ‚Äúgeneric algorithm,‚Äù we mean an algorithm constructed from uninterpreted function symbols, quantifier symbols, and monoid operations. The algebraic nature of the model facilitates a formal treatment of ‚Äúlocal reductions‚Äù based on the ‚Äúlocal replacement‚Äù of terms. Such local reductions ‚Äúpreserve formula structure‚Äù in the sense that structure trees with nice properties transform into structure trees with similar properties. These local reductions can also be used to transform hierarchical specified problems with useful structure into hierarchically specified problems having similar structure."
2001,Complexity and Approximability of Quantified and Stochastic Constraint Satisfaction Problems.,"Abstract
Abstract
Let D be an arbitrary (not necessarily finite) nonempty set, let C be a finite set of constant symbols denoting arbitrary elements of D, and let S and T be an arbitrary finite set of finite-arity relations on D. We denote the problem of determining the satisfiability of finite conjunctions of relations in S applied to variables (to variables and symbols in C) by SAT(S) (by SATc(S).) Here, we study simultaneously the complexity of decision, counting, maximization and approximate maximization problems, for unquantified, quantified and stochastically quantified formulas.
We present simple yet general techniques to characterize simultaneously, the complexity or efficient approximability of a number of versions/variants of the problems SAT(S), Q-SAT(S), S-SAT(S),MAX-Q-SAT(S) etc., for many different such D,C,S,T. These versions/variants include decision, counting, maximization and approximate maximization problems, for unquantified, quantified and stochastically quantified formulas. Our unified approach is based on the following two basic concepts: (i) strongly-local replacements/reductions and (ii) relational/algebraic representability.
Some of the results extend the earlier results in [Pa85,LMP99,CF+93,CF+94] Our techniques and results reported here also provide significant steps towards obtaining dichotomy theorems, for a number of the problems above, including the problems MAX-Q-SAT(S), and MAX-S-SAT(S). The discovery of such dichotomy theorems, for unquantified formulas, has received significant recent attention in the literature [CF+93, CF+94, Cr95, KSW97]."
2001,Gardens of Eden and Fixed Points in Sequential Dynamical Systems.,"A class of finite discrete dynamical systems, called <b>Sequential Dynamical Systems</b> (SDSs), was proposed in [BMR99,BR99] as an abstract model of computer simulations. Here, we address some questions concerning two special types of the SDS configurations, namely Garden of Eden and Fixed Point configurations. A configuration C of an SDS is a Garden of Eden (GE) configuration if it cannot be reached from any configuration. A necessary and sufficient condition for the non-existence of GE configurations in SDSs whose state values are from a finite domain was provided in [MR00]. We show this condition is sufficient but not necessary for SDSs whose state values are drawn from an infinite domain. We also present results that relate the existence of GE configurations to other properties of an SDS. A configuration C of an SDS is a fixed point if the transition out of C is to C itself. The FIXED POINT EXISTENCE (or FPE) problem is to determine whether a given SDS has a fixed point. We show thatthe FPE problem is <b>NP</b>-complete even for some simple classes of SDSs (e.g., SDSs in which each local transition function is from the set{NAND, XNOR}). We also identify several classes of SDSs (e.g., SDSs with linear or monotone local transition functions) for which the FPE problem can be solved efficiently.

2001,Strongly-local reductions and the complexity/efficient approximability of algebra and optimization on abstract algebraic structures.,"We demonstrate how the concepts of algebraic representability and strongly-local reductions developed here and in [20] can be used to characterize the computational complexity/efficient approximability of a number of basic problems and their variants, on various abstract algebraic structures F. These problems include the following:
Algebra: Determine the solvability, unique solvability, number of solutions, etc., of a system of equations on F. Determine the equivalence of two formulas or straight-line programs on F.
Optimization: Let ‚àà > 0.
Determine the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable equations in a system of equations on F; or approximate this number within a multiplicative factor or n‚àà.
Determine the maximum value of an objective function subject to satisfiable algebraically-expressed constraints on F; or approximate this maximum value within a multiplicative factor of n‚àà
Given a formula or straight-line program, find a minimum size equivalent formula or straight-line program; or find an equivalent formula or straight-line program of size ‚™á f(minimum).
Both finite and infinite algebraic structures are considered. These finite structures include all finite non-degenerate lattices and all finite rings or semi-rings with a nonzero element idempotent under multiplication (e.g. all non-degenerate finite unitary rings or semi-rings); and these infinite structures include the natural numbers, integers, real numbers, various algebras on these structures, all ordered rings, many cancellative semi-rings, and all infinite lattices with two elements a,b such that a is covered by b."
2001,Analysis Problems for Sequential Dynamical Systems and Communicating State Machines.,"Abstract
Informally, a sequential dynamical system (SDS) consists of an undirected graph where each node v is associated with a state s v and a transition function f v . Given the state value s v and those of the neighbors of v, the function f v computes the next value of s v . The node transition functions are evaluated according to a specified total order. Such a computing device is a mathematical abstraction of a simulation system. We address the complexity of some state reachability problems for SDSs. Our main result is a dichotomy between classes of SDSs for which the state reachability problems are computationally intractable and those for which the problems are efficiently solvable. These results also allow us to obtain stronger lower bounds on the complexity of reachability problems for cellular automata and communicating state machines."
1998,NC-Approximation Schemes for NP- and PSPACE-Hard Problems for Geometric Graphs.,"Abstract
We present NC-approximation schemes for a number of graph problems when restricted to geometric graphs including unit disk graphs and graphs drawn in a civilized manner. Our approximation schemes exhibit the same time versus performance trade-off as the best known approximation schemes for planar graphs. We also define the concept of Œª-precision unit disk graphs and show that for such graphs the approximation schemes have a better time versus performance trade-off than the approximation schemes for arbitrary unit disk graphs. Moreover, compared to unit disk graphs, we show that for Œª-precision unit disk graphs many more graph problems have efficient approximation schemes.
Our NC-approximation schemes can also be extended to obtain efficient NC-approximation schemes for several PSPACE-hard problems on unit disk graphs specified using a restricted version of the hierarchical specification language of Bentley, Ottmann, and Widmayer. The approximation schemes for hierarchically specified unit disk graphs presented in this paper are among the first approximation schemes in the literature for natural PSPACE-hard optimization problems."

These problems include 3Sat, 1-3Sat, 1-Ex3Sat, Minimum Vertex Cover, Minimum Dominating Set, Minimum Feedback Vertex Set, X3C, Partition Into Triangles, and Clique Cover. We also prove the NP-completeness of the Ambiguous Satisfiability} problems [J. B. Saxe, Two Papers on Graph Embedding Problems, Tech. Report CMU-CS-80-102, Dept. of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, 1980] and the DP-completeness (with respect to random polynomial reducibility) of the unique satisfiability problems [L. G. Valiant and V. V. Vazirani, NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions, in Proc. 17th ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing, 1985, pp. 458--463] associated with several of the above problems, when restricted to planar instances. Previously, very few #P}-hardness results, no {\sf NP}-hardness results, and no DP-completeness results were known for counting problems, ambiguous satisfiability problems, and unique satisfiability problems, respectively, when restricted to planar instances.

Assuming {\sf P \neq $ NP}, one corollary of the above results is that there are no $\epsilon$-approximation algorithms for the problems of maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function subject to a planar system of linear inequality constraints over the integers.

1998,Approximation Algorithms for PSPACE-Hard Hierarchically and Periodically Specified Problems.,"We study the efficient approximability of basic graph and logic problems in the literature when instances are specified hierarchically as in \cite{Le89} or are specified by 1-dimensional finite narrow periodic specifications as in \cite{Wa93}. We show that, for most of the problems ? considered when specified using {\bf k-level-restricted} hierarchical specifications or k-narrow periodic specifications the following holds:
\item Let ? be any performance guarantee of a polynomial time approximation algorithm for ?, when instances are specified using standard specifications. Then ??>0, ? has a polynomial time approximation algorithm with performance guarantee (1+?)?. \item ? has a polynomial time approximation scheme when restricted to planar instances. \end{romannum}
These are the first polynomial time approximation schemes for PSPACE-hard hierarchically or periodically specified problems. Since several of the problems considered are PSPACE-hard, our results provide the first examples of natural PSPACE-hard optimization problems that have polynomial time approximation schemes. This answers an open question in Condon et. al"
1998,Theory of Periodically Specified Problems: Complexity and Approximability.,"Abstract:
We study the complexity and the efficient approximability of graph and satisfiability problems when specified using various kinds of periodic specifications studied previously. We obtain two general results. First, we characterize the complexities of several basic generalized CNF satisfiability problems SAT(S), when instances are specified using various kinds of 1- and 2-dimensional periodic specifications. We outline how this characterization can be used to prove a number of new hardness results for periodically specified problems for various complexity classes. As one corollary, we show that a number of basic NP-hard problems become EXPSPACE-hard when inputs are represented using 1-dimensional infinite periodic wide specifications, thereby answering an open question. Second, we outline a simple yet a general technique to devise approximation algorithms with provable worst case performance guarantees for a number of combinatorial problems specified periodically. Our efficient approximation algorithms and schemes are based on extensions of the previous ideas. They provide the first nontrivial collection of natural NEXPTIME-hard problems that have an /spl epsiv/-approximation (or PTAS)."
1996,An Algebraic Model for Combinatorial Problems.,"A new algebraic model, called the generalized satisfiability problem (GSP) model, is introduced for representing and solving combinatorial problems. The GSP model is an alternative to the common method in the literature of representing such problems as language-recognition problems. In the GSP model, a problem instance is represented by a set of variables together with a set of terms, and the computational objective is to find a certain sum of products of terms over a commutative semiring. The model is general enough to express all the standard problems about sets of clauses and generalized clauses, all nonserial optimization problems, and all $\{ 0,1\} $-linear programming problems. The model can also describe many graph problems, often in a very direct structure-preserving way. Two important properties of the model are the following;1. In the GSP model, one can naturally discuss the structure of individual problem instances. The structure of a GSP instance is displayed in a ìstructure tree.î The smaller the ìweighted depthî or ìchannelwidthî of the structure tree for a GSP instance, the faster the instance can be solved by any one of several generic algorithms. 2. The GSP model extends easily so as to apply to hierarchically specified problems and enables solutions to instances of such problems to be found directly from the specification rather than from the (often exponentially) larger specified object.

1994,Generalized CNF Satisfiability Problems and Non-Efficient.,"Abstract:
We use variants of the generalized CNF satisfiability problems SAT(S) of T.J. Schhaefer (1978) to characterize the efficient approximability of a number of basic NP and PSPACE-hard optimization problems in the literature. In contrast with the recent results, none of our proofs make use of interactive proof systems or of probabilistically checkable debate systems. In particular assuming P/spl ne/NP- or P/spl ne/PSPACE, we show that a number of the optimization problems shown not to be efficiently approximable can be shown not to be efficiently approximable by direct reductions, often of variants of the problems MAX NSF and ambiguous 3SAT. Moreover, often we show this, not only for arbitrary problem instances but also for planar problem instances and for f(n)-treewidth-bounded instances. Thus analogous to Zuckerman (1993), we show that: ""Planar NP-complete, PSPACE-complete, planar PSPACE-complete problems, etc. also have versions that are hard to approximate"".< >"
1994,A Unified Approach to Approximation Schemes for NP- and PSPACE-Hard Problems for Geometric Graphs.,"Abstract
We present parallel approximation schemes for a number of graph problems when restricted to geometric graphs including unit disk graphs and graphs drawn in a civilized manner [CCJ90, MHR92, Te91]. Our NC-approximation schemes exhibit the same time versus performance trade-off as those of Baker [Ba83].
We also define the concept of Œª-precision unit disk graphs and show that for such graphs our NC approximation schemes have better time versus performance trade-offs and several other graph problems have efficient approximation schemes.
Our parallel approximation schemes can also be extended to obtain efficient parallel approximation schemes for problems on unit disk graphs specified using a restricted version of the hierarchical specification language of Bentley, Ottmann and Widmayer [BOW83]. While we can show that many graph problems are PSPACE-hard even for this restricted form of specifications, nevertheless, these problems possess efficient approximation schemes."
1994,Approximation Schemes Using L-Reductions.,"Abstract
We present parallel approximation schemes for a large class of problems in logic and graph theory, when these problems are restricted to planar graphs and Œ¥-near-planar graphs. Our results are based on the positive use of L-reductions, and the decomposition of a given graph into subgraphs for which the given problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. The problems considered include MAX 3SAT, MAX SAT(S), maximum independent set, and minimum dominating set. Our NC-approximation schemes exhibit the same time versus performance tradeoff as those of Baker [Ba83]. For Œ¥-near-planar graphs, this is the first time that approximation schemes of any kind have been obtained for these problems."

Efficient algorithms are presented for solving systems of linear equations defined on and for solving path problems [11] for treewidth k graphs [20] and for Œ±-near-planar graphs [22]. These algorithms include the following:

1990,The Complexity of Equivalence for Commutative Rings.,"We study the deterministic time complexity of the equivalence problems for formulas and for straight-line programs on commutative rings. A general theorem is presented, that yields sufficient conditions on a commutative ring, for these problems for the ring to require ‚Äúessentially as much deterministic time as the set of satisfiable 3CNF formulas‚Äù. As corollaries of this theorem, we characterize the deterministic time complexity of these two equivalence problems, for all finite commutative rings and for all commutative unitary rings of zero or prime characteristic."
1990,Power Indices and Easier Hard Problems.,"Abstract
The concepts of power_index, satisfiability hypothesis (SH), and structure tree are introduced and used to make sharper hypotheses about a problem's complexity than ‚Äúthe problem isNP-complete.‚Äù These concepts are used to characterize the complexities of a number of basicNP-complete problems, including both CLIQUE and PARTITION which are shown to have power-indices at most 1/2. Also, the problem 3SAT is shown to be solvable deterministically in time exponential only in thesquare root ofv+c, wherev is the number of variables andc is the number of ‚Äúcrossovers‚Äù needed to layout the formula in the plane."
1990,The Complexity of Very Simple Boolean Formulas with Applications.,"The concepts of $\textbf{SAT}$-hardness and $\textbf{SAT}$-completeness modulo npolylogn time and linear size reducibility, denoted by $\textbf{SAT}$-hard (npolylogn, n) and $\textbf{SAT}$-complete (npolylogn, n), respectively, are introduced. Regardless of whether $\textbf{P} = \textbf{NP}$ or $\textbf{P} \neq \textbf{NP}$, it is shown that intuitively

Each $\textbf{SAT}$-hard (npolylogn, n) problem requires essentially at least as much deterministic time as, and

Each $\textbf{SAT}$-complete (npolylogn, n) problem requires essentially the same deterministic time as the satisfiability problem for 3CNF formulas.

It is proved that the $\leqq$, satisfiability, tautology, unique satisfiability, equivalence, and minimization problems are already $\textbf{SAT}$-complete (npolylogn, n), for very simple Boolean formulas and for very simple systems of Boolean equations. These completeness results are used to characterize the deterministic time complexities of a number of problems for lattices, propositional calculi, combinatorial circuits, finite fields, rings ${\bf Z}_{k}(k \geqq 2)$, binary decision diagrams, and monadic single variable program schemes. A number of these hardness results are ìbestî possible.

1988,On the Complexity of Satisfiability Problems for Algebraic Structures (Preliminary Report).,"Abstract
For several different algebraic structures S, we study the computational complexity of such problems as determining, for a system of equations on S,
1.
if the system has a solution,
 2.
if the system has a unique solution, and
 3.
the number of solutions of the system.
  Three types of results are obtained. For rings S, we show that these problems are either NP- or coNP-hard, when S is unitary, and in addition, are SAT-hard(npoylogn,n), when S is commutative and unitary. We also show that determining the number of solutions of a system of equations on S is #P-complete, when S is finite and unitary, and in addition, is #SAT-complete(npolylogn,n), when S is finite, commutative, and unitary. Second for all ordered unitary rings S, we show that determining if a system of equations on S has a unique solution is intuitively ‚Äúas hard as‚Äù determining if a system of equations on S has a solution. Third, we characterize the complexity of these problems for additional algebraic structures including each finite or finite-depth lattice."

1987,"Nonlinear Algebra and Optimization on Rings are ""Hard"".","Several general ${\textbf{NP}}$- or ${\textbf{coNP}}$-hardness results are presented for nonlinear algebraic and optimization problems on rings. These results include the following: (1) The problem of determining if a system of nonlinear equations on a ring has a solution is ${\textbf{NP}}$-hard for virtually all of the rings studied in mathematics or computer science. (2) Let S be any nondegenerate ring with a multiplicative identity, and let $ \leqq $ be any linear order on S. Then, the problems of maximizing or of minimizing a linear function on S subject to quadratic constraints are both ${\textbf{NP}}$- and ${\textbf{coNP}}$-hard. (3) Let S be any ordered ring, and let be the associated order. Then, the problems of maximizing or of minimizing a quadratic multiple variable polynomial on S subject to constraints of the form $a \leqq x \leqq b$ are both ${\textbf{NP}}$- and ${\textbf{coNP}}$-hard. Several additional related nonlinear problems for such rings are shown to be ${\textbf{NP}}$-, ${\textbf{coNP}}$-, or #${\textbf{P}}$-hard.

Here, we prove that such dependence is inherent.

Deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are presented for the equivalence and containment problems for unambiguous regular expressions, unambiguous regular grammars and unambiguous finite automata. The algorithms are then extended to ambiguity bounded by a fixed k. Our algorithms depend upon several elementary observations on the solutions of systems of homogeneous linear difference equations with constant coefficients and their relationship with the number of derivations of strings of a given length n by a regular grammar.

1984,Consistency and Serializability in Concurrent Database Systems.,"The main results of this paper show that serialization is both necessary and sufficient for consistency in concurrent database systems. This is true for both the final database and the views of the database seen by individual transactions. The model of a transaction includes both read and write operations which may be performed in any order (except an entity must be read before being written).

The main results are presented in terms of an information flow model describing the source of each value read and the use of each value written. Since the model does not involve any concept of the ìtimeî a value was read or written, it models any concurrency system producing information flow among transactions.

There is a section discussing the effect of changing the model to include write operations without preceding reads, and a section discussing the restriction to straight-line programs.

1981,"On the Equivalence and Containment Problems for Unambiguous Regular Expressions, Grammars, and Automata.","Abstract:
The known proofs that the equivalence and containment problems for the regular and for the linear context-free grammars are PSPACE-complete and undecidable, respecitvely, depend upon consideration of ambiguous grammars. We prove that this dependence is inherent. Deterministic polynomial time algorithms are presented for; (1) the equivalence and containment problems for the unambiguous regular grammars; (2) for all k ‚â• 2, the equivalence and containment problems for the regular grammars of degree of ambiguity ‚â§ k; and (3) the problems of determining if an unambiguous linear context-free grammar is equivalent to or contains an arbitrary regular set. Simple extensions of the grammar classes in (1), (2), and (3) are shown to yield problems that are NP-hard or undecidable. Several new results on the relative economy of description of ambiguous versus unambiguous regular and linear contextfree grammars are also obtained. These results depend upon several observations on the solutions of systems of homogeneous linear difference equations and their relationship with the number of strings of a given length generated by an unambiguous regular or linear context-free grammar."
1981,Distributed Database Concurrency Controls Using Before-Values.,"Associated with the write of a database entity is both the ""before"" or old value, and the ""after"" or new value. Concurrency can be increased by allowing other transactions to read the before values of a given transaction. The ramifications of allowing this, particularly on a distributed system in which limited communications is desirable, are investigated. A careful distinction is made between design decisions concerning communications and design decisions concerning the responses to read/write requests. Two schemes for producing such controls are given, one scheme for systems where processes are committed on termination, and the other for systems where committment is made later."
1978,System Level Concurrency Control for Distributed Database Systems.,"A distributed database system is one in which the database is spread among several sites and application programs ‚Äúmove‚Äù from site to site to access and update the data they need. The concurrency control is that portion of the system that responds to the read and write requests of the application programs. Its job is to maintain the global consistency of the distributed database while ensuring that the termination of the application programs is not prevented by phenomena such as deadlock. We assume each individual site has its own local concurrency control which responds to requests at that site and can only communicate with concurrency controls at other sites when an application program moves from site to site, terminates, or aborts. This paper presents designs for several distributed concurrency controls and demonstrates that they work correctly. It also investigates some of the implications of global consistency of a distributed database and discusses phenomena that can prevent termination of application programs."
1977,An Analysis of Several Heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem.,"Several polynomial time algorithms finding ìgood,î but not necessarily optimal, tours for the traveling salesman problem are considered. We measure the closeness of a tour by the ratio of the obtained tour length to the minimal tour length. For the nearest neighbor method, we show the ratio is bounded above by a logarithmic function of the number of nodes. We also provide a logarithmic lower bound on the worst case. A class of approximation methods we call insertion methods are studied, and these are also shown to have a logarithmic upper bound. For two specific insertion methods, which we call nearest insertion and cheapest insertion, the ratio is shown to have a constant upper bound of 2, and examples are provided that come arbitrarily close to this upper bound. It is also shown that for any $n\geqq 8$, there are traveling salesman problems with n nodes having tours which cannot be improved by making $n/4$ edge changes, but for which the ratio is $2(1-1/n)$.

1974,Attributed Translations.,"Attributed translation grammars are introduced as a means of specifying a translation from strings of input symbols to strings of output symbols. Each of these symbols can have a finite set of attributes, each of which can take on a value from a possibly infinite set. Attributed translation grammars can be applied in depth to practical compiling problems.
Certain augmented pushdown machines are defined and characterizations are given of the attributed translations they can perform both deterministically and non-deterministically. Classes of attributed translation grammars are defined whose translation can be performed deterministically while parsing top down or bottom up."

It is also shown that for any n ‚â• 8, there are traveling salesman problems with n cities having tours which are k-optimal for all k ‚â§ n/4, and for which the ratio with respect to the optimal is 2(1 -1/n)."
1973,Attributed Translations.,"Attributed translations are a means of specifying the input-output relation of a language processing device, such as for example the lexical or syntax box of a compiler. Considered as a mathematical object, an attributed translation is a mapping of certain strings of attributed ‚Äúinput symbols‚Äù into strings of attributed ‚Äúaction symbols‚Äù. Under the interpretation that action symbols represent the act of emitting an attributed output or the performing of some other ‚Äúsemantic actions‚Äù, and the attributes represent ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù information associated with the symbols, the model can be applied in depth to practical compiling problems. Theorems are proved giving conditions under which an attributed translation can be performed by an augmented pushdown machine while it is parsing top down or bottom up. Attributed translations are based on the ideas of attributed grammars [1] and syntax directed translations [2,3]. Other relevant concepts are property grammars and table machines [4], and attributed grammars with relations [5]."
1970,Properties of Deterministic Top-Down Grammars.,"The class of context-free grammars that can be deterministically parsed in a top down manner with a fixed amount of look-ahead is investigated. These grammars, called LL(k) grammars where k is the amount of look-ahead are defined and a procedure is given for determining if a context-free grammar is LL(k) for a given value of k. A procedure is given for eliminating the Œµ-rules from an LL(k) grammar at the cost of increasing k by 1. There exist cases in which this increase is inevitable. A procedure is given for obtaining a deterministic push-down machine to recognize a given LL(k) grammar and it is shown that the equivalence problem is decidable for LL(k) grammars. Additional properties are also given."
1969,Property Grammars and Table Machines.,"A method is given for generalizing context free grammars to include infinite terminal sets. The new grammar has many of the properties of context free grammars (e.g. membership is decidable and recognition by a suitably generalized nondeterministic pushdown device is always possible). Yet, treating each identifier as a separate terminal symbol, the grammar has enough power to describe all of the syntactic and semantic constraints of the declaration structure for variables and labels in ALGOL-60."
1969,Automata-based computational complexity.,"Abstract
Automata theory is the study of abstract computing devices, their organization, and their structure and computational power. Thus, automata theory is necessarily linked to other parts of mathematics which are concerned with ‚Äúconstructability,‚Äù but it goes further into the study of constructability by investigating a variety of abstract computing devices which perform these constructions, relating these devices to the algorithms they execute, and characterizing the simplicity of their operation.
An important goal of automata theory is to understand the computational processes in relation to various classes of problems. The theory must go beyond the notion of computability and include some measure of the difficulty of the computation and how the difficulty is related to the organization of the machine that performs the computation.
Two natural measures of the computational difficulty are the computation time and the amount of memory required to perform the computation on a given computing device. Both of these measures yield a rich computational complexity structure for the computable functions and a variety of results have been established about these complexity classes, their ordering, and their dependence on the organization of the computing device. Interesting applications of the memory-limited computations have been achieved in the study of context-free and context-sensitive languages, where several infinite hierarchies of complexity classes of these languages have been obtained."

These grammars, called LL(k) grammars where k is the amount of look-ahead are first defined and a procedure is given for determining if a context free grammar is LL(k) for a given value of k. It is shown that &egr;-rules can be eliminated from an LL(k) grammar, at the cost of increasing the value of k by one, and a description is given of a canonical pushdown machine for recognizing LL(k) languages. It is shown that for each value of k there are LL(k+l) languages that are not LL(k) languages. It is shown that the equivalence problem is decidable for LL(k) grammars. Additional properties are also given."
1968,Syntax-Directed Transduction.,"A transduction is a mapping from one set of sequences to another. A syntax-directed transduction is a particular type of transduction which is defined on the grammar of a context-free language and which is meant to be a model of part of the translation process used in many compilers. The transduction is considered from an automata theory viewpoint as specifying the input-output relation of a machine. Special consideration is given to machines called translators which both transduce and recognize. In particular, some special conditions are investigated under which syntax-directed translations can be performed on (deterministic) pushdown machines. In addition, some time bounds for translations on Turing machines are derived."
1968,Property Grammars and Table Machines.,"Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to generalize the methods of automata theory to accommodate infinite input alphabets and to propose a method of describing computer languages such as ALGOL-60 with more reliance on grammatical methods and less reliance on semantic constraints. Our chief concern is a natural generalization of a context-free grammar which we call a context-free property grammar. The generalization is straight-forward and can be used in similar fashion to define regular property grammars, context-sensitive property grammars, etc. The chief result is that these contextfree property grammars generate precisely the set of languages recognized by a non-determinated pushdown table machine, which is a straight forward generalization of a pushdown machine. Again it is clear that other kinds of automata have corresponding table versions. The language-machine correspondence is preserved in such a matter that efficient processing schemes for context-free property grammars are suggested by the well-known schemes for context free languages. Before beginning, we mention some mathematical conventions used. If A is a set, then A* represents the set of all finite sequences of elements from A. If w is in A*, then l(w) is the length of word w. The symbol ‚àà represents the null or length zero word. A typical element of A* will be described by ai...an with the understanding that if n = 0, the null string ‚àà is represented and there are no ai in the string. If n is a positive integer, then An represents the set of n dimensional vectors whose components are from A. A typical element of An is represented as (ai,..., an). If I is a set, then AI represents the set of all functions from I to A. Finally 2A represents the set of all subsets of A."

1966,Two-Tape Simulation of Multitape Turing Machines.,"It has long been known that increasing the number of tapes used by a Turing machine does not provide the ability to compute any new functions. On the other hand, the use of extra tapes does make it possible to speed up the computation of certain functions. It is known that a square factor is sometimes required for a one-tape machine to behave as a two-tape machine and that a square factor is always sufficient. The purpose of this paper is to show that, if a given function requires computation time T for a k-tape realization, then it requires at most computation time T log T for a two-tape realization. The proof of this fact is constructive; given any k-tape machine, it is shown how to design an equivalent two-tape machine that operates within the stated time bounds. In addition to being interesting in its own right, the trade-off relation between number of tapes and speed of computation can be used in a diagonalization argument to show that if T(n) and U(n) are two time functions such that inf T(n) log T(n) √∑ U(n) = 0 then there exists a function that can be computed within the time bound U(n) but not within the time bound T(n)."

A transduction is a mapping from one set of sequences to another. A syntax directed transduction is a particular type of transduction which is defined on the grammar of a context free language and which is meant to be a model of part of the translation process used in many compilers. The transduction is considered from an automata theory viewpoint as specifying the input-output relation of a machine. There is a close relationship between a subclass of these transductions, the simple syntax directed transductions, and push-down machines. This relationship is investigated in detail and conditions for such transductions to be performed on push-down machines are obtained. In addition, some time bounds for transductions on Turing machines are derived."

The computational complexity is measured by how fast the number or function can be computed by a multitape computer (Turing machine). It is shown that by means of this measure the computational complexity of numbers and functions can be submitted to rigorous mathematical study and a number of results are obtained."
1964,On the application of pair algebra to automata theory.,"Abstract:
In this paper, we define and discuss generalizations of partition pairs on sequential machines. The object of these generalizations is to suggest a unified approach to problems of information flow and machine structure."
1963,Regularity Preserving Modifications of Regular Expressions.,"This paper is concerned with the problem of determining whether a set of sequences R\t', obtained by some given rule from a regular set of sequences R, is again a regular set. A number of such problems are solved in this paper and a basic technique is used which is easy to apply to problems of this type. This technique yields an explicit construction of the sequential machine which recognizes the sequences in R\t', if R\t' is a regular set.
Among other things it is shown that: (i) the derivative of a regular set R with respect to any set of sequences W is a regular set, although a regular expression designating this set cannot in general be computed; (ii) the set of sequences obtained from a regular set R by removing ‚Äúarbitrary halves‚Äù of the sequences in R and the set of these removed ‚Äúhalves‚Äù are both regular sets; (iii) the set of sequences, obtained from a regular set R by making no more than k changes in any m consecutive digits in sequences from R, is regular; (iv) the set of sequences which can be concatenated in one and only one way from sequences in R is regular."
1963,A Study of Feedback and Errors in Sequential Machines.,"Abstract:
The object of this paper is to study feedback in sequential machines, to classify (according to their seriousness) and analyze errors which arise in the state transitions of machines, and to establish some relations between feedback and errors. It is shown that the previously developed algebraic methods1,2 supply the necessary tools and a rigorous basis for this theory, and relate these new results to previously obtained results about the structure of sequential machines. For example, this work yields the necessary methods to detect the existence of a decomposition of machines into component machines so that the most ``serious'' errors of the computation can occur only in an isolated component machine. This leads to the possibility of imposing selectively different reliability conditions on the component machines to achieve high over-all reliability of the realizations."
1962,Some Dangers in State Reduction of Sequential Machines.,"In this paper we investigate the negative effects of state reduction on the realization of a sequential machine. It is shown that state reduction can destroy realizations of a given sequential machine from sets of smaller machines and thus lead to a sequential machine that is harder to realize.
To understand some of the reasons why and when state reduction should be carried out, several results are obtained which describe the changes of the structure of a sequential machine under state reduction. It is seen that the undesirable effects of state reduction are closely associated with the failure of certain distributive laws to hold between the partitions used for state reduction and the partitions used in the realization of the unreduced machine."
1961,On the State Assignment Problem for Sequential Machines II.,"Abstract:
The object of this paper is to find state assignments for the internal states of a sequential machine such that the logical equations representing the machine are relatively simple. This is done by finding assignments for which the computation of a particular state variable depends only on the previous values of a small subset of the variables. The chief tool is the concept of a partition pair, which describes (loosely speaking) the information going into and resulting from the evaluation of a state variable. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of assignments with reduced dependence is found in terms of these pairs, and their algebraic properties are worked out so that they can be handled and generated. It is shown that the same methods can also be used to find input and output assignments with reduced dependence. The case of ``don't care'' conditions is considered and the theory is seen to apply, except that the failure of an algebraic property makes it weaker."
