2016,Automating Free Logic in Isabelle/HOL.,"Abstract
We present an interactive and automated theorem prover for free higher-order logic. Our implementation on top of the Isabelle/HOL framework utilizes a semantic embedding of free logic in classical higher-order logic. The capabilities of our tool are demonstrated with first experiments in category theory."
2014,Stochastic lambda-calculi: An extended abstract.,"It is shown how the operators in the ìgraph modelî for lambda-calculus (which can function as a programming language for Recursive Function Theory) can be expanded to allow for ìrandom combinatorsî. The result then is a model for a new language for random algorithms.

2014,Cartesian closed categories of separable Scott domains.,"We classify all sub-cartesian closed categories of the category of separable Scott domains. The classification employs a notion of coherence degree determined by the possible inconsistency patterns of sets of finite elements of a domain. Using the classification, we determine all sub-cartesian closed categories of the category of separable Scott domains that contain a universal object. The separable Scott domain models of the ??-calculus are then classified up to a retraction by their coherence degrees.

2012,Lambda Calculus Then and Now.,"A very fast development in the early 1930s, following Hilbert's codification of Mathematical Logic, led to the Incompleteness Theorems, Computable Functions, Undecidability Theorems, and the general formulation of recursive Function Theory. The so-called Lambda Calculus played a key role. The history of these developments will be traced, and the much later place of Lambda Calculus in Mathematics and Programming-Language Theory will be outlined."
2009,"Semilattices, Domains, and Computability (Invited Talk).","As everyone knows, one popular notion of Scott domain is defined as a bounded complete algebraic cpo. These are closely related to algebraic lattices: (i) A Scott domain becomes an algebraic lattice with the adjunction of an (isolated) top element. (ii) Every non-empty Scott-closed subset of an algebraic lattice is a Scott domain. Moreover, the isolated ($=$ compact) elements of an algebraic lattice form a semilattice (under join). This semilattice has a zero element, and, provided the top element is isolated, it also has a unit element. The algebraic lattice itself may be regarded as the ideal completion of the semilattice of isolated elements. This is all well known. What is not so clear that is that there is an easy-to-construct domain of countable semilattices giving isomorphic copies of all countably based domains. This approach seems to have advantages over both ``information systems'' or more abstract lattice formulations, and it makes definitions of solutions to domain equations very elementary to justify. The ``domain of domains'' also has an immediate computable structure."
2008,Reconsidering Ordered Pairs.,"The well known Wiener-Kuratowski explicit definition of the ordered pair, which sets (x,y) = {{x}, {x,y}}, works well in many set theories but fails for those with classes which cannot be members of singletons. With the aid of the Axiom of Foundation, we propose a recursive definition of ordered pair which addresses this shortcoming and also naturally generalizes to ordered tuples of greater length. There are many advantages to the new definition, for it allows for uniform definitions working equally well in a wide range of models for set theories. In ZFC and closely related theories, the rank of an ordered pair of two infinite sets under the new definition turns out to be equal to the maximum of the ranks of the sets.

2004,Equilogical spaces.,"It is well known that one can build models of full higher-order dependent-type theory (also called the calculus of constructions) using partial equivalence relations (PERs) and assemblies over a partial combinatory algebra. But the idea of categories of PERs and ERs (total equivalence relations) can be applied to other structures as well. In particular, we can easily define the category of ERs and equivalence-preserving continuous mappings over the standard category  of topological T0-spaces; we call these spaces (a topological space together with an ER) equilogical spaces and the resulting category Equ. We show that this categoryóin contradistinction to óis a cartesian closed category. The direct proof outlined here uses the equivalence of the category Equ to the category PEqu of PERs over algebraic lattices (a full subcategory of  that is well known to be cartesian closed from domain theory). In another paper with Carboni and Rosolini (cited herein), a more abstract categorical generalization shows why many such categories are cartesian closed. The category Equ obviously contains  as a full subcategory, and it naturally contains many other well known subcategories. In particular, we show why, as a consequence of work of Ershov, Berger, and others, the KleeneñKreisel hierarchy of countable functionals of finite types can be naturally constructed in Equ from the natural numbers object  by repeated use in Equ of exponentiation and binary products. We also develop for Equ notions of modest sets (a category equivalent to Equ) and assemblies to explain why a model of dependent type theory is obtained. We make some comparisons of this model to other, known models.

2002,Local Realizability Toposes and a Modal Logic for Computability.,"This work is a step toward the development of a logic for types and computation that includes not only the usual spaces of mathematics and constructions, but also spaces from logic and domain theory. Using realizability, we investigate a configuration of three toposes that we regard as describing a notion of relative computability. Attention is focussed on a certain local map of toposes, which we first study axiomatically, and then by deriving a modal calculus as its internal logic. The resulting framework is intended as a setting for the logical and categorical study of relative computability.

2001,A New Category for Semantics.,"Abstract
Domain theory for denotational semantics is over thirty years old. There are many variations on the idea and many interesting constructs that have been proposed by many people for realizing a wide variety of types as domains. Generally, the effort has been to create categories of domains that are cartesian closed (that is, have products and function spaces interpreting typed lambda-calculus) and permit solutions to domain equations (that is, interpret recursive domain definitions and perhaps untyped lambda-calculus)."

2000,"Powersets, Fixed Points, and Lambda Calculus.","The Knaster-Tarski Fixed-Point Theorem applies to monotone self-maps of a powerset, giving the existence of minimal and maximal fixed points. An analogy in Category Theory gives ó for certain categories and certain functors ó the existence of initial algebras and final coalgebras. For some interesting kinds of functors, this categorical construction can be reduced back to powersets and monotone functions. Applications include the construction of some new lambda-calculus models based on initial algebras and final coalgebras.

1998,Type Theory via Exact Categories.,"Abstract:
Partial equivalence relations (and categories of these) are a standard tool in semantics of type theories and programming languages, since they often provide a cartesian closed category with extended definability. Using the theory of exact categories, we give a category-theoretic explanation of why the construction of a category of partial equivalence relations often produces a cartesian closed category. We show how several familiar examples of categories of partial equivalence relations fit into the general framework."

1996,What Can We Hope to Achieve From Automated Deduction? (Abstract).,"We have been fortunate that the capacity and speed of computers has increased so quickly over the last decade. Many research groups around the world have been able to make new, stronger implementations and to solve new problems. Many limitations still exist, however, and as a field we must decide on the designs and objectives for the next period of work. Should we give more attention to user interfaces? Should we make better connections to computer algebra? Should we make strong efforts to construct large-scale knowledge bases? Should we investigate non-standard or non-classical logics? Should we be concerned with pedagogical applications? Where should we look for other applications? All of these questions - and others - need to be answered, and a survey of possibilities will be presented."

The system is formulated as a typed system of combinators (or as a typed ?-calculus) with a recursion operator (the least fixed-point operator), and its proof rules are contrasted to a certain extent with those of the untyped ?-calculus. For publication (1993), a new preface has been added, and many bibliographical references and comments in footnotes have been appended.

1992,Extensional PERs.,"A search is conducted for a class of PERs (partial equivalence relations on the natural numbers) such that the resulting full subcategory has the expected properties of any good category of CPOs: it should be a CCC (Cartesian closed category) and every endomorphism should have a canonical fixed point. Moreover the reflection functor (usually called the lifting operation) should yield a good notion of partial map. The following topics are discussed: conventions, partial-map classifiers, ExPERS, ExPERS as domains, reflectivity of strict maps, multicorreflectivity of strict maps, the extensional natural numbers, domain equations, and intrinsic descriptions."

1985,Semantically Based Programming Tools (Summary).,"Abstract
It is one of our fundamental theses that major improvements in software engineering practice will come about only through the development and use of software development tools. This thesis is based on our belief that formal methods will ultimately have a far more profound effect on software engineering productivity than management based methods, programming language design, or fast hardware. But we also believe that formal methods, by their nature, are suitable for practical use only in mechanized systems. This is not to say that everything is to be automated; the point is that the actual formal steps must be automated even if most of the guidance for their use is to come from the user. This is the same kind of observation that prompted the developers of LCF to introduce the ML type structure to protect the notion of ‚Äútheorem,‚Äù together with formal deductive structure that defines it, from the surrounding heuristic apparatus. It must be expected that heuristics will be under continual development, but a deductive system is fragile and will change only infrequently."
1983,First Steps Towards Inferential Programming.,"Our basic premise is that the ability to construct and modify programs will not improve without a new and comprehensive look at the entire programming process. Past theoretical research, say, in the logics of programs, has tended to focus on methods for reasoning about individual programs; little has been done, it seems to us, to develop a sound understanding of the process of programming ó the process by which programs evolve in concept and in practice. At present, we lack the means to describe the techniques of program construction and improvement in ways that properly link verification, documentation and adaptability."
1982,Domains for Denotational Semantics.,"Abstract
The purpose of the theory of domains is to give models for spaces on which to define computable functions. The kinds of spaces needed for denotational sematics involve not only spaces of higher type (e.g. function spaces) but also spaces defined recursively (e.g. reflexive domains). Also required are many special domain constructs (or functors) in order to create the desired structures. There are several choices of a suitable category of domains, but the basic one which has the simplest properties is the one sometimes called consistently complete algebraic cpo's. This category of domains is studied in this paper from a new, and it is to be hoped, simpler point of view incorporating the approaches of many authors into a unified presentation. Briefly, the domains of elements are represented set theoretically with the aid of structures called information systems. These systems are very familiar from mathematical logic, and their use seems to accord well with intuition. Many things that were done previously axiomatically can now be proved in a straightfoward way as theorems. The present paper discusses many examples in an informal way that should serve as an introduction to the subject."
1977,Logic and Programming Languages.,"Logic has been long interested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization. More recently, precise comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become available through the developments in complexity theory. These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question is whether methods of logic have significance in the other direction for the more applied parts of computability theory. Programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete. Though we have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging mathematical answers to these queries: What is a machine? What is a computable process? How (or how well) does a machine simulate a process? Programs naturally enter in giving descriptions of processes. The definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem) and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). So far the theories of automata and of nets, though most interesting for dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic aspects. It would seem that the understanding of higher-level program features involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine. These levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures. The experience of many independent workers with the method of data types as lattices (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering, and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on implementations. Nevertheless much remains to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say we have a unified theory."
1976,Data Types as Lattices.,"The meaning of many kinds of expressions in programming languages can be taken as elements of certain spaces of ìpartialî objects. In this report these spaces are modeled in one universal domain ${\bf P} \omega $, the set of all subsets of the integers. This domain renders the connection of this semantic theory with the ordinary theory of number theoretic (especially general recursive) functions clear and straightforward.

On the one hand we have our concepts of mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, sets), and on the other we have various formal means of expression. The mathematical expressions are generated for the most part in a very regular manner, and every effort is made to supply all expressions with denotations. (This is not always so easy to do. The theory of distributions, for example, provided a non-obvious construction of denotations for expressions of an operational calculus. The derivative operator was well serviced, but one still cannot multiply two distributions.)"
